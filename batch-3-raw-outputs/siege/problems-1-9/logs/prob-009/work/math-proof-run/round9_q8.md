kind: attempt
Open question attempted: the run's missing statement MS8 (ledger entry 68), through the one obstruction that round 8 raised against it: the persistent-twin / endpoint-twin configuration (R8-8 Prop. 3; R8-4 §5 conditions (T1)–(T3); R8-5 Prop. D). Either overcome it (prove it cannot occur, which settles the twin half of MS8) or sharpen it into a counterexample to MS8.

## Task
Decide whether the following configuration can occur, and prove your answer.

**Configuration (PT).** The data are:
- V_0, a smooth closed 2-dimensional totally geodesic surface in M_g;
- an admissible family V_t satisfying (R1), (R2) and (Rig) (MS8's setting, below), with t ↦ Y_t non-constant.

Proposition K's chain from ∂V_0 (PR-H §3) undergoes a twin jump. By R8-8 Prop. 3 this means one of two things:
- (i) at some junction J_m the next piece D^{m+1} carries two distinct constant vertices c_{m+1} ≠ w, both with value ≅ Y_0 at t = 0, with [φ_w] ≡ [Y] but [φ_{c_{m+1}}] ≢ [Y], and the track enters D^{m+1} on c_{m+1};
- (ii) at the endpoint Q_0 two Y_0-copies x, a^{-1}x (a ∈ Aut(Q_0)) are such that x merges, or puncture-moves, along the terminal branch b, while a^{-1}x is intact and constant along b with value function ≡ Y.

Further necessary conditions are in R8-4 §5 and §3:
- twins at every t = 0 merge point (Corollary G1);
- failure of (Tw1)+(C1)+(C2) at every cusp (Theorem 2V);
- failure of (IP), (U_J), (Lock), (NB) at the relevant point.

**Option 1 (overcome).** Prove that (PT) cannot occur. Candidate mechanisms (you may use others):
- On the piece D^{m+1} at t = 0, the two constant vertices c, w both have value ≅ Y_0 along the whole piece. Use Theorem TV (the piece's Teichmüller vertex and the limiting-disc map φ̂, R8-10 below) and total geodesy of V_0 to show either of the following:
  - the generic curve of D^{m+1} has an automorphism exchanging c and w that persists along the transported piece D^{m+1}_t, which forces φ_c ≡ φ_w (Lock);
  - c and w are distinguished by the network: one of them merges at a cusp of D^{m+1} reachable inside the Y-network, which contradicts the generic-time trichotomy at time t.
- At the endpoint, the same with the pair x, a^{-1}x at Q_0, using the Krull pair at one lift (R8-3 Corollary T).

**Option 2 (sharpen into a counterexample).** Exhibit a concrete smooth closed totally geodesic V_0 whose boundary network realises the t = 0 part of (PT), and then an admissible family realising the twin jump. Covering constructions are the natural source: deck transformations permute boundary components, so twins are typical. The run proved that for every Galois covering construction over M_{0,5} or M_{1,2} the t = 0 merge condition holds via an explicit merge at a cusp of ∂V_0 (not reproduced here). Write every check out, and say exactly where realisability of the family V_t (all of (i), (ii) of the problem in the readings (R1), (R2), and (Rig)) is verified or still open.

A result covering only some V_0 does not settle MS8; report it, labelled as partial, if that is all you find.

## Readings of the problem's hypotheses (adopted throughout; state them in any proof)
- (R1) closure(𝒱) ⊂ M̄_g × Δ is a closed analytic set whose fibre over t is closure(V_t) (closures in M̄_g).
- (R2) There is a homeomorphism H: closure(V_0) × Δ → closure(𝒱) over Δ with the following properties:
  - it is smooth on V_0 × Δ;
  - it maps (closure(V_0) ∩ Δ_G) × Δ onto closure(𝒱) ∩ (Δ_G × Δ) for every stratum Δ_G, including the open stratum M_g.
  - Write H_t = H(·,t); one may assume H_0 = id.
  - This is our formalisation of "smoothly trivial" together with (i) and (ii). It is the coarse reading: H_t need not preserve automorphism groups of boundary points.
- Notation:
  - B_t := closure(V_t) \ V_t.
  - A "Y_t-copy" of a stable curve is an irreducible component which, with its special points (preimages of nodes and marked points) in some order, is isomorphic to Y_t as an n_i-pointed curve.

## The missing statement MS8 and its chain

**Definitions used below** (unchanged from round 8).
- A *piece at time t* is a 1-dimensional irreducible component E of ξ_G^{-1}(closure(V_t) ∩ Δ_G) ⊂ ∏_{w∈V(G)} M_w, for some stable graph G (any G).
- ν: Ē → ∏M̄_w is the normalization of its closure.
- A *puncture* is a point p ∈ Ē with ν(p) ∉ ∏M_w. Put f_u = pr_u∘ν.
- M(E) := {u : f_u non-constant}.
- K(E) := the closure of the image of E in ∏_{u∈M(E)} M̄_u.

**Chain.**
1. Entry 19: t ↦ Y_t is holomorphic. So if Y_t lies in a finite (or countable) set for t in a set accumulating in Δ, then Y ≡ Y_0.
2. Entry 70 (Theorem TV, with (F2) now proved) together with entry 45 (Lemma PA): every piece at time 0, in every stratum, has a Teichmüller vertex. Its π_j∘ν is a proper orbifold covering of a Teichmüller curve whose lift is the Teichmüller disc.
3. Entry 56 (L2 under (O_G), product strata), the L2′ sketch (non-product strata), entry 54 (L1′) and entry 71 (Lemma U) give **(Rig)**:
   - there is a finite set 𝒦 of triples (G, M, K), up to Aut(G), with M ⊂ V(G) and K an irreducible closed curve in ∏_{u∈M} M̄_u not contained in its boundary;
   - every piece E at every time t has (G, M(E), K(E)) ∈ 𝒦.
   - This is entry 82 (OPEN; replaces entry 69). It still needs (O_G) for every piece and L2′. By round8_q9 (Examples Z, Z′), it cannot follow from piece-level data alone; it needs global input.
   - Consequence: all puncture values of non-constant vertices lie in a t-independent finite set F.
4. **MS8** (entry 68, wording unchanged): (Rig) ⇒ Y_t = Y_0 for all t.

Steps 1–4 give the goal from MS8 together with entry 82.
- MS8 is the strongest intermediate claim the main line needs next. After MS8, only entry 82 remains.
- MS8 is quantified over all admissible V_0 and families; it is not a sub-class.
- Inside MS8, entry 72 (R8-2 Theorem 1) already settles the generic-time analysis. What MS8 still needs is to connect the t = 0 track of Prop K (entry 50) to generic t across twins and crossings.

**Missing statement (MS8)** (unchanged; OPEN entry 68, locator round8_plan).
- *Setting.* g ≥ 2. V_0 ⊂ M_g is a smooth closed 2-dimensional subvariety, totally geodesic for the Teichmüller metric.
  - V_t (t ∈ Δ) is a holomorphic family deforming V_0 as in the problem, satisfying (i), (ii) in the readings (R1), (R2), with H_0 = id.
  - Δ_Γ ≅ ∏_j M_{g_j,n_j} is of product type. ∂V_t := closure(V_t) ∩ Δ_Γ has dimension 1, and π_i(∂V_t) = {Y_t} for all t, for a fixed i with dim M_{g_i,n_i} > 0.
  - V_t is not assumed totally geodesic for t ≠ 0.
- *Hypothesis (Rig)*, as in chain step 3: there is a finite set 𝒦 of triples (G, M, K), M ⊂ V(G), K ⊂ ∏_{u∈M} M̄_u an irreducible closed curve not contained in the boundary, such that for every t ∈ Δ and every piece E at time t, (G, M(E), K(E)) ∈ 𝒦 up to the action of Aut(G).
- *Conclusion.* Y_t = Y_0 for all t ∈ Δ.

### PR-H. Lemma PA (positive area at generic boundary points), Lemma NH and Proposition K (the Y_0-network reaches a MERGE or MOV branch) (from round6_q9, verbatim, sections 1–3)
## 1. Gap (d): Lemma PA (proved, modulo cited standard facts)

### 1.1 Cited standard facts (from memory)
- **(Pl) Plumbing chart.** Near P ∈ Δ_Γ there is a holomorphic orbifold chart of M̄_g with coordinates (z, t) = (z, (t_e)_{e∈E(Γ)}), built as follows. z ranges over a neighbourhood of P in ∏_w T_w (or a Kuranishi chart of the product); the component Y_w(z) is obtained from the fixed Y_w = Y_w(0) by a quasiconformal deformation whose Beltrami differential is supported in a fixed compact set K_w ⊂ Y_w, disjoint from fixed coordinate discs {|z_e| < 1} around the punctures. The surface X(z,t) is obtained by plumbing z_e w_e = t_e in these discs. (Masur 1976; Bers; Wolpert. Cited from memory.) Consequently:
  - the tangent vector ∂/∂z_k at (z,t) is represented on X(z,t) by the transplanted Beltrami differential of the deformation of the components, supported in ι(K_w) and with sup norm bounded uniformly in t;
  - the vector ∂/∂t_e at (z,t) is represented by a Beltrami differential supported in the collar of e (computed in 1.2).
- **(Dual) Teichmüller norm.** For a tangent vector v at X represented by a Beltrami μ, ‖v‖_T = sup{Re ∫ μφ : φ ∈ Q(X), ‖φ‖_1 = 1}, where Q(X) is the space of integrable holomorphic quadratic differentials (at most simple poles at punctures). The supremum is attained at a unique φ = q_v (the norming differential), and the Teichmüller disc through X tangent to v is the disc generated by q_v. (Teichmüller, Hamilton–Krushkal, Royden; classical.)
- **(Bun) Quadratic differentials at a stable curve.** For the plumbing family, π_*(ω^{⊗2}) is a vector bundle of rank 3g−3 whose fibre at P is H^0(P, ω_P^{⊗2}): differentials on the components with at most double poles at the node branches, with equal leading (double-pole) coefficients a_e on the two branches of each node. The functionals a_e (leading coefficient in the plumbing coordinate z_e, i.e. a_e(φ) = (2πi)^{-1}∮_{|z_e|=r_0} z_e φ/dz_e) are holomorphic on the bundle and linearly independent at P; their common kernel at P is ⊕_w Q(Y_w). (Standard; dimension count Σ_w(3g_w−3+n_w) = 3g−3−|E(Γ)|.)

### 1.2 The collar Beltrami
In the collar of e at X(z,t_0), use the coordinate z = z_e on {|t_0| < |z| < 1} (with w_e = t_0/z). For t near t_0 define F_t(z) = z·exp(c·λ(z)), λ(z) = log|z| / log|t_0|, c = log(t/t_0), and F_t = id off the collar. Then F_t is the identity at |z| = 1, and in the w-coordinate it is w ↦ w (t/t_0)^{1−λ}, the identity at |w| = 1. So F_t: X(z,t_0) → X(z,t) is quasiconformal. Its Beltrami coefficient is
 μ_t = (z/z̄) · (c/(2 log|t_0|)) / (1 + c/(2 log|t_0|)).
Differentiating at t = t_0 (c ≈ δ := (t − t_0)/t_0): the vector δ·t_0 ∂/∂t_e is represented by the Beltrami (δ/(2 log|t_0|))·(z/z̄) on the collar, with sup norm |δ|/(2 log(1/|t_0|)). Hence

 **(C)** ‖b ∂/∂t_e‖_T ≤ |b| / (2 |t_e| log(1/|t_e|)).

### 1.3 The statement
**Lemma PA.** Let P be a generic point of ∂V_0 (outside a discrete subset of ∂V_0). There are X_n ∈ V_0, X_n → P, and generating pairs (X_n, q_n), ‖q_n‖_1 = 1, such that, after passing to a subsequence, the transplanted differentials ι_n^*q_n converge locally uniformly on each component Y_w of P to q_w ∈ Q(Y_w) with:
1. Σ_w ‖q_w‖_1 = 1 (no area is lost in the collars);
2. q_w ≠ 0 only for vertices w at which ∂V_0 moves (in a sense made precise below); in particular q_i = 0;
3. there is a vertex j ≠ i with q_j ≠ 0, i.e. j carries positive area in the sense of PR-F (F) with s_n = 1.
In particular hypothesis (PA) of PR-F holds, at every generic point of ∂V_0.

*Proof.*
**Step 1 (local model).** Let ν: N → closure(V_0) be the normalization of a local irreducible component (branch) of the germ of closure(V_0) along ∂V_0 near P, lifted to the manifold chart of (Pl). Normal surfaces have isolated singular points, and the preimage of ∂V_0 is a curve; so for generic P, N is smooth at the point over P, with coordinates (s, τ) in which the preimage of ∂V_0 is {τ = 0}. The plumbing coordinates pull back to holomorphic functions t_e(s,τ) vanishing on {τ = 0}; write t_e = u_e(s,τ) τ^{m_e} with m_e ≥ 1 and u_e not divisible by τ. The zero set of u_e meets {τ = 0} in a discrete set, which we avoid (genericity). Also z(s,0) parametrizes ∂V_0, and for generic P, a := ∂_s z(s_0,0) ≠ 0 (the parametrization of the curve ∂V_0 is an immersion off a discrete set). Since π_i is constant on ∂V_0, the i-component of a is 0: a = (a_w)_w with a_i = 0.

**Step 2 (the vectors v_n).** Take τ_n → 0 and X_n := ν(s_0, τ_n) ∈ V_0 (points with τ ≠ 0 are in V_0 since t_e ≠ 0 there). Let v_n := dν(∂_s) at (s_0,τ_n), a tangent vector to V_0. In plumbing coordinates v_n = (∂_s z(s_0,τ_n), (∂_s t_e(s_0,τ_n))_e), with ∂_s z(s_0,τ_n) → a and ∂_s t_e = (∂_s u_e) τ^{m_e}, so |∂_s t_e| ≤ C|t_e| because u_e is a unit near (s_0,0). By (Pl) and (C), v_n is represented by a Beltrami differential μ_n = Σ_w ι_n^* μ_w^{(n)} + ν_n, where μ_w^{(n)} is supported in K_w, depends continuously on the vector and converges to a Beltrami μ_w on Y_w representing a_w (take μ_i^{(n)} → 0, since a_i = 0), and ‖ν_n‖_∞ ≤ C' / log(1/max_e|t_e(X_n)|) → 0.

**Step 3 (upper bound).** Put A := max_w ‖a_w‖_{T(Y_w)} > 0 (a ≠ 0). Let φ_n ∈ Q(X_n), ‖φ_n‖_1 = 1. By normal families (an L^1-bounded family of holomorphic quadratic differentials is locally uniformly bounded), after a subsequence ι_n^*φ_n → φ_w locally uniformly on each Y_w. By Fatou on the disjoint images ι_n(K) of exhausting compacts, Σ_w ‖φ_w‖_{L^1(Y_w)} ≤ 1; in particular φ_w is integrable, hence φ_w ∈ Q(Y_w). Then
 Re ∫ μ_n φ_n → Σ_w Re ∫_{Y_w} μ_w φ_w ≤ Σ_w ‖a_w‖ ‖φ_w‖ ≤ A Σ_w ‖φ_w‖ ≤ A,
using |∫ ν_nφ_n| ≤ ‖ν_n‖_∞ → 0 and (Dual) on Y_w. Hence limsup ‖v_n‖_T ≤ A.

**Step 4 (lower bound).** Let j attain the maximum, and φ ∈ Q(Y_j) with ‖φ‖ = 1 and Re ∫ μ_j φ = A. The element φ ⊕ 0 lies in the fibre at P of the subbundle ker(a_e : e ∈ E(Γ)) of (Bun); extend it to a holomorphic section of that subbundle and let φ_n be its value at X_n. Then ι_n^*φ_n → φ on Y_j and → 0 on the other components, locally uniformly. **Collar mass.** In the collar {|t|/r_0 < |z| < r_0} of an edge e write φ_n = Σ_k c_k z^k dz². By construction c_{−2} = a_e(φ_n) = 0. The coefficients c_k, k ≥ −1, are bounded by C r_0^{−k} (Cauchy estimates on |z| = r_0, where φ_n is uniformly bounded). The terms with k ≤ −3 are, in the coordinate w = t/z, the terms c_k t^{k+2} w^{−k−4} dw² with −k−4 ≥ −1, bounded likewise by Cauchy on |w| = r_0. Since ∫_{|z|<ρ}|z|^k dA ≤ 2πρ^{k+2}/(k+2) ≤ 2πρ for k ≥ −1, ρ ≤ 1, the mass of φ_n in {|t|/ρ < |z| < ρ} is ≤ Cρ for ρ ≤ r_0/2, uniformly in n. With convergence on the thick parts this gives ‖φ_n‖_1 → ‖φ‖ = 1. Then Re ∫ μ_n φ_n → Re ∫ μ_j φ = A. So liminf ‖v_n‖_T ≥ A, and ‖v_n‖_T → A.

**Step 5 (the norming differentials).** Let q_n be the norming differential of v_n (‖q_n‖ = 1). By (Dual) the Teichmüller disc tangent to v_n is generated by q_n; since v_n is tangent to V_0 and V_0 is totally geodesic, (X_n,q_n) is a generating pair. Pass to a subsequence with ι_n^*q_n → q_w on each Y_w. As in Step 3,
 A = lim Re ∫ μ_n q_n = Σ_w Re ∫ μ_w q_w ≤ Σ_w ‖a_w‖‖q_w‖ ≤ A Σ_w ‖q_w‖ ≤ A.
All inequalities are equalities. Hence Σ_w ‖q_w‖ = 1 (item 1); q_w = 0 unless ‖a_w‖ = A (item 2; in particular q_i = 0 since a_i = 0 and A > 0); and some q_j ≠ 0, j ≠ i (item 3); moreover q_w norms a_w whenever q_w ≠ 0. ∎

**Remarks.**
- This closes gap (d) of PR-F §6 completely, at every generic point of ∂V_0, with positive area located at a vertex j where the tangent vector of ∂V_0 has maximal Teichmüller norm.
- By Proposition C of PR-F, π_j(E) is then a Teichmüller curve (E the component of ∂V_0 through P), π_j|_E is orbifold-unramified onto it, and closure(∂V_0) ≠ ∂V_0 has cusps. (PR-F's Lemma T' depends on (F2), which PR-F only sketched; I have not re-proved (F2).)
- Corollary (full area): the area of the limit sits entirely on the moving vertices at maximal speed; in particular for the generic P the limit differential (q_w)_w on P is a genuine area-1 integrable differential on the stable curve P, with q_i = 0.
- The same proof applies verbatim to **any** 1-dimensional irreducible component E of closure(V_0) ∩ Δ_G, for any product-type stratum Δ_G and any generic point of E (only the local model of Step 1 was used, plus a ≠ 0). Used in §4.

## 2. Gap (c), first half: choice of direction (proved)

Setting: P, (X_n,q_n), (q_w)_w and j as in Lemma PA. For e ∈ Γ_i (edges at i) let γ_e be the core curve of the e-collar of X_n. Transport curves along Teichmüller maps X_n → g_s X_n, where g_s = diag(e^{-s}, e^{s}) contracts horizontal and expands vertical q-lengths ("path marking").

**Lemma NH.** After passing to a subsequence and replacing q_n by e^{-2iθ_n} q_n with θ_n → 0 (which keeps all conclusions of Lemma PA, the rotation being absorbed in the limit), we may assume:
1. there is an essential, non-peripheral curve c of Y_j (hence of S_g, not homotopic to any Γ-curve) and m > 0 such that each q_n has a horizontal cylinder in the class c_n of c of modulus ≥ m; hence Ext_{g_sX_n}(c_n) ≤ e^{-2s}/m for all s ≥ 0;
2. there is e_0 ∈ Γ_i such that the q_n-geodesic representative of γ_{e_0} is not horizontal; hence Ext_{g_sX_n}(γ_{e_0}) → ∞ as s → ∞, for each n.

*Proof.*
- (Cited from memory: Masur.) Cylinder directions of a finite-area quadratic differential are dense in RP^1. A cylinder core of (Y_j,q_j) is non-peripheral: a flat cylinder boundary bounding a disc with at most one simple pole contradicts Gauss–Bonnet (PR-F, Step 5 of Lemma T').
- For each e ∈ Γ_i, the q_n-geodesic representative of γ_e is a chain of saddle connections or a cylinder core. If all its segments are parallel, call their direction θ_n(e) ∈ RP^1; otherwise θ_n(e) is undefined. Pass to a subsequence along which, for e = e_0 fixed, either θ_n(e_0) is always undefined or θ_n(e_0) → θ_∞(e_0).
- Choose a cylinder direction of q_j different from θ_∞(e_0) and rotate so that it is horizontal. Let A be the open horizontal cylinder, A' ⋐ A a compact sub-annulus of modulus m' > 0. On ι_n(A') the differentials q_n converge to q_j in C^1; √q_n is defined on ι_n(A') for large n (the sign holonomy is discrete), so the developing map of ι_n(A') is equivariant under a translation v_n → v ∈ R \ {0}. Its image contains a straight strip in direction v_n of width close to that of A', so q_n has a cylinder in the class of c of modulus ≥ m := m'/2, in direction arg v_n → 0. Put θ_n := arg v_n and rotate. Then this cylinder is exactly horizontal. Under g_s its modulus is multiplied by e^{2s}, giving item 1.
- Since arg v_n → 0 ≠ θ_∞(e_0), for large n γ_{e_0} is not horizontal for the rotated q_n. So some saddle connection of its geodesic has nonzero vertical component, and its vertical measure v := i(γ_{e_0}, F_hor(q_n)) is > 0. (The q-geodesic realizes the intersection numbers with both measured foliations; standard, cited.) Then ℓ_{g_sq_n}(γ_{e_0}) ≥ e^{s}v, and Ext ≥ ℓ²/Area = ℓ² ≥ e^{2s}v² → ∞. ∎

**Remark.** This bypasses gaps (a) and (b) of PR-F §6. Item 1 needs only one exactly horizontal cylinder, obtained by a rotation tending to 0, and not a Jenkins–Strebel q_n. No interchange of the limits is needed below, because I work with connected limit sets instead of the Jenkins–Strebel limits Z_n.

## 3. Proposition K: Y_0 merges or moves somewhere on its own boundary network (proved, modulo routine marking details)

Notation:
- B := closure(V_0) \ V_0. This is a compact 1-dimensional analytic set; work on a level cover if needed.
- Σ_i ⊂ S_g is the subsurface of vertex i, and ∂Σ_i = {γ_e : e ∈ Γ_i}. Both are path-marked.
- ψ(X) ∈ M̄_{g_i,n_i} is the "Σ_i-part" of X. Fix a pants decomposition of Σ_i. ψ(X) is the surface with the Fenchel–Nielsen coordinates of X inside Σ_i and boundary lengths set to 0. It is continuous on augmented Teichmüller space near points where ∂Σ_i is pinched, and there it equals the stable curve on the Σ_i-side.
- d is a metric on M̄_{g_i,n_i}.

**Cited facts (from memory).**
- Kerckhoff: Ext_Y(γ) ≤ e^{2 d_T(X,Y)} Ext_X(γ).
- Maskit's comparison (Ext) of PR-F.
- Lemma G / G′ of PR-F: limits of g_{s_n}X_n with s_n → s* < ∞ lie in ∂V_0. Each such limit equals φ(g_{s*}), up to a subsequence of the φ's.

For δ, η > 0 let T_n = T_n(δ,η) be the first s ≥ 0 at which max_{e∈Γ_i} Ext_{g_sX_n}(γ_e) = δ or d(ψ(g_sX_n), Y_0) = η.

**Step 1 (T_n is finite and tends to ∞).** By Lemma NH(2), Ext(γ_{e_0}) → ∞ along the ray, so T_n < ∞. For s in a compact set, g_sX_n converges to points of ∂V_0, uniformly in s (Lemma G′). At those points ∂Σ_i is pinched and ψ = Y_0, because vertex i of every point of ∂V_0 is Y_0. Hence T_n → ∞.

**Step 2 (the continuum).** Let K = K(δ,η) be a Hausdorff limit (subsequence) of the compact connected sets {g_sX_n : 0 ≤ s ≤ T_n}. Then K is compact and connected, and it contains P. Every point of K is a limit of g_{s_n}X_n with s_n ≤ T_n:
- if s_n stays bounded, the limit lies in ∂V_0 ⊂ B;
- if s_n → ∞, the curve c is pinched by Lemma NH(1), so the limit lies in B.

So K ⊂ B. On K, every ∂Σ_i curve has Ext ≤ δ (in the limit sense along the approximating sequences) and d(ψ, Y_0) ≤ η. Let Q = Q(δ,η) ∈ K be a limit of the endpoints g_{T_n}X_n. Then Q ∈ B, and either
- (a) some γ_e, e ∈ Γ_i, has Ext = δ > 0 at Q, so it is unpinched at Q; or
- (b) d(ψ(Q), Y_0) = η.

**Step 3 (δ_k, η_k → 0).** Pass to a subsequence with K(δ_k,η_k) → K_0 and Q_k := Q(δ_k,η_k) → Q_0. Then K_0 ⊂ B is compact and connected, and contains P and Q_0. At every point of K_0 the curves ∂Σ_i are pinched (Ext ≤ δ_k → 0 along approximating sequences) and the Σ_i-side is the single smooth component Y_0. So vertex "i" is intact, ≅ Y_0, at every point of K_0, consistently with the path marking.

**Proposition K.** There are a compact connected set K_0 ⊂ B containing ∂V_0's point P, along which the Σ_i-component is intact and equal to Y_0, a point Q_0 ∈ K_0, and a 1-dimensional branch b of B at Q_0 such that one of the following holds:
- **(MERGE)** along b \ {Q_0} some curve of ∂Σ_i is unpinched, i.e. the Y_0-component of Q_0 is merged with other components along b (the merge property of PR-C, at Q_0);
- **(MOV)** along b all of ∂Σ_i stays pinched, but the Σ_i-component is non-constant along b, with limit Y_0 at Q_0.

*Proof.*
- In case (a) for infinitely many k, Q_k ≠ Q_0, because γ_e is pinched at Q_0 and unpinched at Q_k. Put Q̃_k → Q̃_0 in augmented Teichmüller space by choosing lifts and applying mapping classes, so that the path markings converge; this is possible since M̄_g is the quotient of augmented Teichmüller space.
- Near Q_0, B is a finite union of branches, each of which minus Q_0 lies in one stratum. Infinitely many Q_k lie on one branch b, and γ_e is unpinched on b \ {Q_0}: (MERGE).
- In case (b) for infinitely many k: if some ∂Σ_i curve is unpinched at infinitely many Q_k, argue as before to get (MERGE).
- Otherwise ∂Σ_i is pinched at the Q_k, so the Σ_i-side of Q_k is a union of components with ψ(Q_k) at distance η_k > 0 from Y_0 = ψ(Q_0). Again Q_k ≠ Q_0, and the Q_k lie on one branch b, along which ψ is non-constant: (MOV). ∎

**What Proposition K does not give.**
- Q_0 need not lie in closure(∂V_0). K_0 can leave closure(∂V_0) through "STAY" branches: branches of B at points of closure(∂V_0) along which the Y_0-vertex stays intact and constant, but which are not contained in closure(∂V_0).
- The ρ-variant settles nothing. Add the stopping condition "g_sX_n leaves the ρ-neighbourhood of closure(∂V_0)", with η ≪ ρ. That variant shows: **at some point Q ∈ closure(∂V_0) there is a branch of B, not contained in closure(∂V_0), of type MERGE, MOV or STAY.** This is only Lemma C1 of PR-C with the extra edge located; it does not exclude STAY.
- Heuristic for why STAY should really occur, from the multi-scale picture, not proved. Suppose the zero-area part of the limit at P has two levels below the top: a vertex w at level −1 and the vertex i at level −2, attached below w. Along the ray, lower levels are "released" (become commensurate with the contracted top-level skeleton) top-down. w merges with the top-level skeleton first, along a branch b_w at the cusp Q of ∂V_0, and the Y_0-vertex is still intact and constant along b_w. The merge of Y_0 then happens at a cusp of b_w, which is in general not in closure(∂V_0).




### PR-I. The quintic-cover example, the Krull/twin mechanism, Lemma D (merge or twin), the Pinning Lemma and Theorem 4 (from round6_q6, verbatim, sections 2–4). The example surface is NOT smooth (it has a coarse A_1 point at y^5 = x^5 − x and two fixed-locus sheets crossing at the Fermat quintic; proved in round6_q3), so it is a test case, not an admissible V_0.

## 3. In the example the problem's conclusion still holds: the twin mechanism

**Proposition 3.** Let V_0 be the surface of Section 2. Let V_t be a family as in the problem, with readings (R1), (R2), and with ∂V_t := closure(V_t) ∩ Δ_Γ 1-dimensional and π_1(∂V_t) = {Y_t}. Assume condition (O) of PR-E for the piece E_0 = ∂V_0 and the genus-4 vertex. Then Y_t = Y_0 for all t ∈ Δ.

(Smoothness of V_0 plays no role in the argument.)

*Proof.*

**Step 0 (rigid factor).**
- π_2 : ∂V_0 = {Y_0} × C → C is a bijection, and C is the covering-construction curve from M_{0,4}.
- The lift T_{0,4} → T_{4,1} is a holomorphic isometric embedding. It is equivariant for the subgroup of Mod_{0,4} that preserves the monodromy data. So hypothesis (H_0) of PR-E holds: π_2(∂V_0) is a Teichmüller curve in the orbifold sense. Its normalization is the quotient of the disc by the stabilizer of the Teichmüller disc (standard).
- By Lemma R\* (PR-E, under (O)), K := closure(π_2(∂V_t)) = closure(C) ⊂ M̄_{4,1} for every t.
- K is an irreducible compact curve meeting M_{4,1}, so K_∂ := K ∩ ∂M̄_{4,1} is finite.
- Let F ⊂ M_{2,1} be the finite set of 1-pointed curves that occur as a smooth component of a point of K_∂, marked at one of its special points.

**Step 1 (the transported cusp).**
- Put P_t := H_t(P_0). Since H_t preserves strata, closure(V_t) ∩ Δ_{G'} = {P_t}, closure(V_t) \ V_t = ∂V_t ⊔ {P_t}, and P_t ∈ closure(∂V_t).
- So P_t is a chain A_t — B_t — C_t of genus-2 curves. A_t and C_t each carry one node point, and B_t carries two.

**Step 2 (local chart).**
- Let Def(P_t) be the versal deformation germ of P_t, a smooth germ of dimension 15 on which Aut(P_t) acts. The germ of M̄_6 at P_t is Def(P_t)/Aut(P_t).
- Let s_1, s_2 be the smoothing parameters of the nodes A–B and B–C. The locus {s_1 = 0 ≠ s_2} maps to Δ_Γ, with genus-2 vertex the deformation of A_t. The locus {s_2 = 0 ≠ s_1} also maps to Δ_Γ, with genus-2 vertex the deformation of C_t. The locus {s_1 = s_2 = 0} maps to Δ_{G'}.
- Let S̃ ⊂ Def(P_t) be the preimage of the germ of closure(V_t). It is analytic by (R1), since a fibre of an analytic set is analytic. It is of pure dimension 2, since V_t is a dense 2-dimensional manifold in closure(V_t) and the quotient map is finite.
- Moreover S̃ ∩ {s_1 s_2 = 0} is the preimage of ∂V_t ∪ {P_t}, and S̃ ∩ {s_1 = s_2 = 0} = {0}.

**Step 3 (A_t ≅ Y_t).**
- Since P_t ∈ closure(∂V_t), S̃ ∩ {s_1 s_2 = 0} has a branch β̃ through 0.
- β̃ \ {0} is connected and lies in the disjoint union of the relatively open sets {s_1 = 0 ≠ s_2} and {s_2 = 0 ≠ s_1}. Renaming A ↔ C if needed, β̃ \ {0} ⊂ {s_1 = 0 ≠ s_2}.
- Points of β̃ \ {0} lie over ∂V_t, so their genus-2 component (the A-side one) is Y_t. That component depends continuously on the point of the chart, and its value at 0 is A_t. Hence A_t ≅ Y_t as 1-pointed curves.

**Step 4 (the second branch; Lemma C1 of PR-C).**
- Let X_S be an irreducible component of S̃ containing β̃. The function s_2 is not identically 0 on X_S, because it is nonzero on β̃ \ {0}, and s_2(0) = 0.
- So {s_2 = 0} ∩ X_S is of pure dimension 1 through 0. It does not contain β̃, so it contains a branch b̃ ≠ β̃ with b̃ \ {0} ⊂ {s_2 = 0 ≠ s_1}, using S̃ ∩ {s_1 = s_2 = 0} = {0}.
- Points of b̃ \ {0} lie over closure(V_t) ∩ Δ_Γ = ∂V_t, so their genus-2 component, now the C-side one, is Y_t. Letting the point tend to 0 gives C_t ≅ Y_t.

**Step 5 (pinning).**
- Along β̃, π_2 takes values in π_2(∂V_t) ⊂ K: the genus-4 curve obtained by smoothing B ∪ C.
- Its limit at 0 is W_t := B_t ∪ C_t, glued at the B–C node and marked at the point of B_t over the A–B node. So W_t ∈ K ∩ ∂M̄_{4,1} = K_∂.
- C_t is a smooth component of W_t, marked at its special point, so C_t ∈ F. By Step 4, Y_t ∈ F for every t ∈ Δ.
- t ↦ Y_t is continuous (PR-A) and takes values in a finite set, so it is constant on the connected set Δ. ∎

**Remarks.**
1. Lemma 1 shows that the lift R = (Y_t, W_t) has an *unmerged* copy of Y_t at vertex 1, so Theorem P's (T0-a) fails. The pinning instead comes from a *second* copy (twin) C_t of Y_t, which sits inside the boundary point W_t of the *rigid* Teichmüller factor at the other vertex. Step 4 forces this twin to exist at every t: it is the local analytic Lemma C1 combined with the fact that no other boundary curves exist near P_t.
2. Proposition 3 needs neither t small nor hypothesis (ii) beyond (R2). It uses the totally geodesic structure of V_0 only through Step 0.

## 4. General consequences: a dichotomy, a pinning lemma, and a twin criterion

Throughout this section assume (R1), (R2) and the problem's hypotheses. Write P_t := H_t(P_0).

**Lemma D (merge or twin).** Fix t. Let P ∈ closure(∂V_t) \ ∂V_t lie in Δ_{G'}. Let S̃ be the preimage of the germ of closure(V_t) in the versal deformation germ Def(P), and let s_e (e ∈ E(G')) be the smoothing parameters. For a boundary branch c̃ of S̃ through 0, let S_c ⊂ E(G') be the set of edges with s_e ≡ 0 on c̃. Let β̃ be a branch lying over ∂V_t. Then:
1. The edges of G' not in S_β are contracted by the induced contraction c_β : G' → Γ. Its preimage c_β^{-1}(i) is a single vertex j with no loops and no contracted edges, and the component P_j is isomorphic to Y_t.
2. Let b̃ be another boundary branch with the merge property, i.e. some edge f of G' at j has f ∉ S_b. Then exactly one of the following holds.
   - **(D1) Merge.** b̃ lies over a 1-dimensional piece E of closure(V_t) ∩ Δ_{G_b} with G_b ≠ Γ. Then π_v(E) is non-constant, where v is the vertex of G_b containing j (Lemma C2 of PR-C).
   - **(D2) Twin.** b̃ lies over ∂V_t. Then c_b^{-1}(i) is a single loop-free vertex j' ≠ j, and P_{j'} ≅ Y_t. So P has a second component isomorphic to Y_t.

*Proof.*
1. Along β̃ \ {0}, the i-coordinate is the constant smooth curve Y_t. Its limit at 0 is the stable curve assembled from the components P_k, k ∈ c_β^{-1}(i), glued along the edges of G' contracted into i.
   - This limit is the smooth curve Y_t. So the assembled curve has no node, which means c_β^{-1}(i) is one vertex j with no contracted edges or loops, and P_j ≅ Y_t.
2. The coarse image of b̃ \ {0} lies in a single stratum, by connectedness. If that stratum is not Δ_Γ we are in (D1).
   - Otherwise b̃ lies over closure(V_t) ∩ Δ_Γ = ∂V_t. Part 1, applied to b̃, gives the single loop-free vertex j' = c_b^{-1}(i) with P_{j'} ≅ Y_t.
   - The edge f at j is contracted by c_b (f ∉ S_b). So the vertex c_b(j) contains a contracted edge, hence c_b(j) ≠ i, i.e. j ≠ j'. ∎

**Lemma (Pinning).** Let 𝒰 be a finite set of pairs (E_0, u). Here E_0 is a 1-dimensional component of closure(V_0) ∩ Δ_{G}, G product type, u is a vertex of G, π_u(E_0) is a Teichmüller curve in the orbifold sense, and condition (O) of PR-E holds for (E_0, u). Put E_t := H_t(E_0). Suppose:

**(Pin)** For every t in a disc around 0 there is (E_0, u) ∈ 𝒰 such that Y_t is isomorphic, after relabelling, to a smooth component of a point of closure(π_u(E_t)) ∩ ∂M̄_u.

Then Y_t = Y_0 for all t ∈ Δ.

*Proof.*
1. By Lemma R\* (PR-E), closure(π_u(E_t)) = closure(π_u(E_0)) =: K_u for all t. Each K_u ∩ ∂M̄_u is finite.
2. So Y_t lies in a fixed finite set for t in the disc. By continuity (PR-A) it is constant there.
3. By holomorphy (PR-A) and the identity theorem, Y_t = Y_0 on Δ. ∎

The step-3 argument of Theorem P shows that **(T0) ⇒ (Pin)**. Proposition 3 shows that **(Pin) holds in the example of Section 2**, where (T0) fails. The following criterion abstracts Proposition 3. Like (T0), it is a condition on V_0 alone.

**Theorem 4 (twin criterion).** Let P_0 ∈ closure(∂V_0) \ ∂V_0 lie in Δ_{G'}. Let 𝒞 be the set of edge sets S ⊂ E(G') such that contracting E(G') \ S gives a graph identified with Γ, by an identification compatible with ξ_Γ, in which the preimage of vertex i is a single loop-free vertex j(S). Assume:
- **(Tw1)** There is a neighbourhood U of P_0 with (closure(V_0) \ V_0) ∩ U ⊂ ∂V_0 ∪ {P_0}.
- **(Tw2)** For all S ≠ S' in 𝒞:
  - j(S) ≠ j(S');
  - the vertex w = w(S, S') of Γ that contains j(S') under the contraction by S has an edge of G' among the edges contracted into it;
  - for every component E_0 of ∂V_0 with P_0 ∈ closure(E_0), π_w(E_0) is a Teichmüller curve in the orbifold sense satisfying (O).

Then Y_t = Y_0 for all t ∈ Δ.

*Proof.*
1. **Transport.** By (R2), H_t maps closure(V_0) ∩ U onto a neighbourhood of P_t in closure(V_t), preserving strata. So near P_t, closure(V_t) \ V_t ⊂ ∂V_t ∪ {P_t}, and in Def(P_t) we have S̃ ∩ {all s_e = 0, e ∈ E(G')} = {0}.
   - G' and its combinatorics are the same at P_t as at P_0, because the stratum is preserved. The set 𝒞 depends only on G' and Γ.
2. **The branch β̃.** Take a branch β̃ of the preimage of ∂V_t through 0. By Lemma D(1), S_β ∈ 𝒞, and P_t has the component Y_t at j := j(S_β).
   - S_β ≠ E(G'), since P_t ∉ Δ_Γ.
3. **The branch b̃.** Pick e ∉ S_β. Lemma C1 of PR-C, as in Step 4 of Proposition 3, gives a boundary branch b̃ ≠ β̃ through 0 with e ∈ S_b.
   - By Step 1, b̃ lies over ∂V_t. So S_b ∈ 𝒞 by Lemma D(1), S_b ≠ S_β, and P_t has the component Y_t at j' := j(S_b) ≠ j, by (Tw2).
4. **The good vertex.** Let E_t = H_t(E_0) be the component of ∂V_t containing the image of β̃, so P_0 ∈ closure(E_0). Let w = w(S_β, S_b).
   - Along β̃ the w-coordinate converges to the stable curve assembled from the components of P_t over w, which include P_{j'} ≅ Y_t.
   - That curve has a node, by (Tw2). So it lies in closure(π_w(E_t)) ∩ ∂M̄_w, and Y_t is one of its smooth components.
5. **Conclusion.** This is (Pin) with 𝒰 the finite set of pairs (E_0, w) allowed by (Tw2), and it holds for every t. The Pinning Lemma concludes. ∎

**Check against Section 2.**
- G' is the chain A — e_1 — B — e_2 — C, and 𝒞 = {{e_1}, {e_2}} with j({e_1}) = A and j({e_2}) = C.
- w({e_1}, {e_2}) is the genus-4 vertex, which contains the edge e_2. Symmetrically, w({e_2}, {e_1}) contains e_1.
- π_2(∂V_0) = C is a Teichmüller curve. (Tw1) holds because closure(V_0) \ V_0 = ∂V_0 ⊔ {P_0}.
- So Proposition 3 is the case (Tw) of Theorem 4, modulo (O).

**What this means for MS5 and the chain.**
- MS5 (= (T0)) is not the right missing statement. It is false without smoothness (Section 2), and the problem's conclusion survives there via (Tw).
- The correct target is **(Pin)**, or the V_0-only disjunction **"(T0) or (Tw) holds at some point P_0 of closure(∂V_0)"**. Both are still open in general.
- Lemma D explains why a disjunction is natural. At a cusp, Lemma C1 always produces a second boundary branch b̃. If b̃ has the merge property, it is either a genuinely new boundary curve (D1, the (T0) mechanism) or ∂V_t again with a twin (D2, the (Tw) mechanism).
- What neither mechanism covers:
  - a cusp where no branch b̃ merges vertex j and no twin arises: the non-merge case of PR-C, still open;
  - (D1)-branches whose merged vertex is not a Teichmüller curve: positive area not established, (PA) of PR-F;
  - (D2)-twins whose host vertex w is not a Teichmüller curve or carries no node.



### R7-1. Time-t lemmas, constant vertices at junctions, and Theorem T (MS6 near t = 0 under (Lock)) (from round7_q6, verbatim, sections 1–3)
## 1. Fixed-t local lemmas (proved)

Fix t. Let Q ∈ B_t, let x ∈ V(G_Q) be a vertex with Q_x a Y_t-copy, and let b be a 1-dimensional branch of B_t at Q. Let b̃ be a branch at a lift q of Q in Def(Q) of π^{-1}(b), with pinched set S_b := {e : s_e ≡ 0 on b̃} and U_b := E(G_Q) \ S_b. Let G_b := G_Q/U_b; this is the dual graph along b̃ \ {q}, which lies in one stratum. Let E be the 1-dimensional piece of closure(V_t) ∩ Δ_{G_b} containing π(b̃ \ {q}), lifted to ∏_w M_w in the way the local labelling of b̃ induces. Let p ∈ Ē be the point over Q determined by b. Write [x] for the vertex of G_b containing x.

**Lemma 1 (merges and puncture-moves give MS6).**
- (a) Suppose some edge of G_Q at x lies in U_b ("merge"). Then f_{[x]} is non-constant on E, p is a puncture of E, and f_{[x]}(p) has the component Q_x with the same special points. So MS6 holds at t, witnessed by (E, [x], p).
- (b) Suppose all edges at x lie in S_b, Q ∉ Δ_{G_b} (i.e. U_b ≠ ∅), and f_{[x]} = f_x is non-constant on E. Then p is a puncture and f_x(p) = Q_x ≅ Y_t. So MS6 holds at t.

*Proof.*
- (a) By (Def1), as r → q along b̃ the [x]-component of C_r tends to the curve glued from the components Q_y, y ∈ [x], along the edges of U_b inside [x]. This set of edges contains an edge at x, so the limit is a nodal curve in ∂M̄_{[x]}. Off q the [x]-component lies in M_{[x]}. So f_{[x]} is non-constant (PR-C, Lemma C2), and ν(p) ∉ ∏_w M_w, so p is a puncture.
  - Q_x is a component of the limit curve f_{[x]}(p). Its special points there are the branches of nodes internal to [x] together with the marked points coming from edges leaving [x]. Together these are exactly the node branches of Q at Q_x. So the pointed curve is unchanged.
- (b) Here [x] = {x}, and by (Def1) f_x(p) = Q_x. Some edge of G_Q lies in U_b, so it is contracted into some vertex w of G_b, and f_w(p) is nodal. Hence ν(p) ∉ ∏ M_w, and p is a puncture. ∎

**Lemma 2 (closedness).** N_t := {Q ∈ B_t : Q has a Y_t-copy} is closed in B_t. More generally: if t_n → t, Q_n ∈ B_{t_n}, Q_n → Q, and Q_n has a Y_{t_n}-copy, then Q has a Y_t-copy.

*Proof.*
- Lift to Def(Q): r_n → q. Pass to a subsequence with U(r_n) = U constant, and with the copy of Q_n at a fixed vertex V of G_Q/U.
- By (Def1), the V-component of C_{r_n} converges to the curve glued from the Q_y, y ∈ V, along the edges of U inside V. Since Y_{t_n} → Y_t (PR-A) and Y_t is smooth, this limit is smooth.
- So V is a single vertex y, with no edge of U at y forming a node inside V, and Q_y ≅ Y_t. ∎

**Lemma 3 (dichotomy at a point of N_t).** Suppose MS6 fails at t. Let Q ∈ N_t, let x be any Y_t-copy of Q, and let b be any branch of B_t at Q (any lift b̃). Then exactly one of the following holds:
- (STAY) all edges at x are pinched along b̃, and f_x is constant (≡ Q_x) on the piece E of b; or
- (IMOV, interior move) all edges at x are pinched along b̃, U_b = ∅ (so Q ∈ E is an interior point of the piece, in the same stratum), and f_x is non-constant on E.

Consequently, if moreover no IMOV occurs at points of N_t, then N_t is open in B_t. By Lemma 2 it is then a union of connected components of B_t, and it contains the connected component C_t of B_t containing ∂V_t (on which vertex i is a copy).

*Proof.*
- Lemma 1(a) excludes a merge, and Lemma 1(b) excludes a non-constant f_x with U_b ≠ ∅. What remains is STAY or IMOV.
- Openness: near Q, B_t is the union of its finitely many branches b. If b is STAY for some copy x, the points of b near Q carry the constant component Q_x, so they lie in N_t. ∎

**Remarks on the approach of the task.**
1. IMOV cannot be excluded by Lemma 1: an interior point is not a puncture. L1 and L2 give only that Y_t lies on the t-independent curve closure(π_x(E_0)), with value Y_t = g(σ(t)) where g is one of finitely many maps (L2) and σ(t) := A_t^{-1}(Q̃_t) ∈ Ē_0. The point σ(t) is the transported "junction point" Q_t on E_t. Nothing ties it to a puncture or to a cone point of Ē_t, because A_t is the Thurston/Teichmüller identification and not H_t. So the IMOV case is **not pinned** by these tools. It remains open (see §4).
2. **Step 2(b) is dead in the stated generality (heuristic, not proved).** At a fixed t ≠ 0, V_t is an arbitrary algebraic surface: total geodesy is not available. The only time-t inputs are (R1) and the local analytic structure. A configuration in which a connected component C of the boundary carries a fixed isolated constant component Y is not locally contradictory. Near such a component, closure(V_t) looks like a smoothing of "Y glued to a moving family", with the normal direction contracting (negative normal degree, -ψ·C < 0, so Grauert contractibility is consistent). I did not construct a global algebraic example, so this is only a heuristic. But it shows that any contradiction must come from t = 0, as in option (a), and hence must face the twin problem. §2 explains exactly where that problem enters, and §3 bypasses it under (Lock).

## 2. Where option 2(a) breaks: twins (analysis)

Suppose MS6 fails, and Lemma 3 gives N_{t_n} ⊇ C_{t_n} = H_{t_n}(C_0) for generic t_n → 0. Pass to t = 0, and fix Q_0 ∈ C_0 together with the MERGE branch b of Proposition K, in which the tracked copy c of Q_0 merges along a lift b̃.
- For lifts q_n → q_0 of Q_{t_n}, every lift-branch b̃_n of b_{t_n} at q_n converges into a lift γ b̃ of b, for some γ ∈ Aut(Q_0). By the edge count of Step 3 below, its pinched set is S_{b̃_n} = γ S_b̃. So the label γc merges along b̃_n.
- The Y_{t_n}-copies of Q_{t_n} converge to Y_0-copies of Q_0 (Lemma 2), so the limiting labels lie in Λ(Q_0) := {ℓ ∈ V(G_{Q_0}) : Q_{0,ℓ} is a Y_0-copy}.
- But γc need not be among them. Q_0 may have several Y_0-copies, a merged one and an unmerged twin, and for t ≠ 0 these may stop being isomorphic. Then the merged one is not a Y_t-copy, and no contradiction arises.

This is exactly the twin phenomenon of PR-G/PR-I. Option (a) and the direct transport of §3 fail or succeed at the same place. I therefore isolate the needed property as a hypothesis.

**Definition (Lock).** Let R ∈ B_0 ∩ Δ_{G'}, let q_0 ∈ Def(R) be a lift, and let Λ(R) ⊂ V(G') be the set of labels of Y_0-copies of R. Note that Λ(R) is Aut(R)-invariant. R is *locked* if there is ε > 0 such that, for |t| < ε and every lift q of R_t := H_t(R) in a fixed small neighbourhood of q_0 in Def(R), the components C_{q,ℓ}, ℓ ∈ Λ(R), are pairwise isomorphic as pointed curves up to reordering.
- (Lock) holds trivially if |Λ(R)| = 1, i.e. R has a unique Y_0-copy.
- It holds at the point P_0 of the quintic example (PR-I, Proposition 3, Steps 3–4: A_t ≅ C_t ≅ Y_t for all t, and Λ(P_0) = {A, C} since B_0 has two special points).
- Note that R_t ∈ Δ_{G'} for all t by (R2), so its lifts lie in D' := {s_e = 0 for all e} ⊂ Def(R), where the labels make sense.

### R7-3. Kuranishi-chart transport lemmas, (TR) without twins, the twin dichotomy, and a chart-local twin-jump model (from round7_q5, verbatim, sections 1–5)
## 1. Set-up: Kuranishi charts and chart components

**Standard facts (cited from memory).**

(K1) Let J be a stable curve. It has a universal deformation over a smooth germ Def(J), with smoothing parameters s_e for the nodes e ∈ E(G_J), and Aut(J) acts on Def(J). A neighbourhood of J in M̄_g is Def(J)/Aut(J). So the preimages in Def(J) of a point J′ near J form one Aut(J)-orbit.

(K2) Let x be a vertex of G_J, and let L_x := {s_e = 0 for every edge e at x}, a smooth subgerm. Over L_x the fibre curve has a component "x", deforming J_x. This gives a holomorphic map F_x : L_x → M_{g_x,n_x}. Its special points are labelled by the half-edges at x.

(K3) For σ ∈ Aut(J) and q ∈ L_x we have σq ∈ L_{σx}, and σ induces an isomorphism of fibre curves taking component x to component σx. Hence

 F_x(σq) ≅ F_{σ^{-1}x}(q)  (as pointed curves, after relabelling).

Throughout, "≅ Y" means isomorphic as an n_i-pointed curve up to relabelling. Equivalently, we compare images in the coarse space M_{g_i,n_i}/S_{n_i}, which is an analytic space. All identity-theorem arguments below take place there.

**Interpretation of the hypotheses of (TR).** "The c_m-limit along D^m and the c_{m+1}-limit along D^{m+1} are the same component of J_m (tracked by path markings)" is read as follows. There are lifts β̃^m, β̃^{m+1} ⊂ Def(J_m), through 0, of the relevant branches of ξ(D^m) and ξ(D^{m+1}) at J_m, and a vertex x_m of G_{J_m}, such that:
- c_m is the single chart vertex x_m along β̃^m;
- c_{m+1} is the single chart vertex x_m along β̃^{m+1}.

This is what continuity of the marking inside the chart gives. The merge at Q_0 is read the same way: there are lifts β̃^k, β̃^E ⊂ Def(Q_0) and a chart vertex x with c_k = {x} along β̃^k and x ∈ class(u) along β̃^E.

A constant vertex c has a smooth limit at J. So c corresponds to a single chart vertex with no contracted edges, and the branch lies in L_x.

## 2. Transport lemmas

**Lemma 1 (constant values are holomorphic; generic constancy).** Let D be a piece at time 0, D_t := H_t(D) its transport, and c a vertex of D's graph.
(a) If c is constant on D, then c is constant on D_t for every t. Its value φ_c(t) is a holomorphic function of t.
(b) If c is non-constant on D, then c is non-constant on D_t for all t outside a countable set.

*Proof.* (a) Constancy is L1. Fix p ∈ D. Then φ_c(t) = pr_c of a lift of H(p,t). This is continuous in t, because H is continuous and lifts through the finite map ξ can be chosen continuously along paths.

Let 𝓦 be the irreducible 2-dimensional analytic set of Lemma R0 (PR-D) for D. Then Γ := (pr_c, t)(𝓦) is an irreducible analytic set (Remmert), whose fibre over each t is finite by L1. So Γ is a curve, finite over Δ. A continuous function whose graph lies in such a curve is holomorphic off a discrete set, where the curve is locally a union of graphs, and hence everywhere by Riemann extension.

(b) Let C ⊂ 𝓦 be the analytic set where (pr_c, t) has rank ≤ 1. Suppose pr_c is constant on the fibre components over uncountably many t. Then C contains uncountably many fibre curves. A ≤ 1-dimensional analytic set contains only countably many of them, so C = 𝓦. By the rank theorem the image Γ is then an irreducible curve that is not contained in a fibre of t, so it is finite over Δ. Hence pr_c is constant on every fibre component, including at t = 0. ∎

**Lemma 2 (transport of a lifted branch in a fixed chart).** Let J ∈ closure(V_0) \ V_0 and J(t) := H_t(J). Let β̃ ⊂ Def(J) be a lifted branch at 0 of a piece D, where either J is a puncture of D, or J ∈ ξ(D) and β̃ is the lifted germ of D itself. Let x be a chart vertex such that a vertex c, constant on D, equals {x} along β̃. Then for |t| < ε there is a set Ñ ⊂ Def(J) × Δ_ε with the following properties:
- Ñ is a connected analytic set with Ñ ∩ {t = 0} = β̃ \ {0}, or β̃ itself in the interior case;
- for each t, closure(Ñ_t) contains a lift J̃_β(t) of J(t), and Ñ_t ∪ {J̃_β(t)} ⊂ L_x;
- F_x ≡ φ_c(t) on Ñ_t ∪ {J̃_β(t)}.

*Proof (puncture case; the interior case is the same with D's own lifted family).*

1. Let β be the image branch of ξ(D) at J. Then N := H((β \ {J}) × Δ_ε) is a topologically trivial family of punctured discs. By (R2), near J(t) we have closure(ξ(D_t)) ∩ Δ_{G_J} = {J(t)}, because closure(ξ(D)) \ ξ(D) is finite and H_t is a stratum-preserving homeomorphism.
2. Let Ñ be the connected component of the preimage of N in Def(J) × Δ_ε that contains β̃ \ {0}. The preimage of the analytic family of D is analytic (Lemma R0 and Remmert), and N is open and closed in it near (J,0). So Ñ is analytic. Ñ is a connected topological 4-manifold, being a cover of a punctured disc times a disc. Hence Ñ is irreducible: removing a singular set of real codimension ≥ 2 does not disconnect it.
3. The pinching pattern {e : s_e ≡ 0} is constant on the irreducible set Ñ. At t = 0 it contains every edge at x, so Ñ ⊂ L_x.
4. Fix once and for all an identification of the contracted graph with D's graph. This gives a holomorphic map from Ñ to ∏_w M_w. Its image is irreducible and meets the lift of D at t = 0. So it lies in the lifted family 𝓦 of D, and F_x = pr_c on Ñ. By L1 and Lemma 1, pr_c ≡ φ_c(t) on 𝓦_t.
5. Ñ_t → N_t = β_t \ {J(t)} is proper and finite (K1). So points of Ñ_t approaching J(t) accumulate at lifts of J(t). Pick one, J̃_β(t). It lies in L_x because L_x is closed, and F_x(J̃_β(t)) = φ_c(t) by continuity of F_x. ∎

**Remark.** The same proof applies when the vertex containing x along β̃ is a non-constant vertex u. Then the u-limit at J̃_β(t) is the curve obtained by gluing the chart components in class(u) at J̃_β(t). This is a puncture value f_u^t(p) of D_t, at the puncture of D_t lying over J(t). Moreover u is non-constant on D_t whenever class(u) contains a contracted edge: a constant smooth curve cannot have a nodal limit (Lemma C2 of PR-C).

**Lemma 3 (twist).** Let β̃, β̃′ be lifted branches at 0 ∈ Def(J), with transports Ñ, Ñ′ and lifts J̃_β(t), J̃_{β′}(t). Then for each t there is σ_t ∈ Aut(J) with J̃_{β′}(t) = σ_t J̃_β(t). Some single σ occurs for all t in a set T_σ that is uncountable, and in particular accumulates at 0.
Moreover σ_t^{-1}·closure(Ñ′_t) is a lifted branch of D′_t through J̃_β(t). Along it, the vertex containing a chart vertex y is the σ_t^{-1}-image of the vertex of Ñ′_t containing σ_t y.

*Proof.* The two lifts of J(t) lie in one Aut(J)-orbit by (K1). Aut(J) is finite, and a finite union of the sets T_σ covers the uncountable disc. Aut(J) preserves the preimage of closure(V_t). The last statement is (K3). ∎

## 3. Theorem A: (TR) holds without twins

**Hypothesis (NT).**
- For each junction J_m (m < k): every σ ∈ Aut(J_m) fixes the chart vertex x_m.
- At Q_0: every σ ∈ Aut(Q_0) fixes x.

A sufficient condition: no other component of J_m (respectively Q_0) is isomorphic to the x_m-component (respectively the x-component), as a curve with unordered special points.

**Theorem A.** Assume the hypotheses of (TR), L1, and (NT). Then:
- φ_{c_m} ≡ Y for every m;
- for all t in a disc around 0 minus a countable set, the transported piece E_t has a vertex u that is non-constant on E_t and a puncture p′ such that f_u^t(p′) has a component isomorphic to Y_t.

*Proof.*
1. **Junctions.** Fix m < k. Apply Lemma 2 at J = J_m to (β̃^m, c_m, x_m) and to (β̃^{m+1}, c_{m+1}, x_m). This gives
 F_{x_m}(J̃^m(t)) = φ_{c_m}(t) and F_{x_m}(J̃^{m+1}(t)) = φ_{c_{m+1}}(t).
 By Lemma 3, J̃^{m+1}(t) = σ_t J̃^m(t). By (K3) and (NT),
 F_{x_m}(σ_t J̃^m(t)) = F_{σ_t^{-1}x_m}(J̃^m(t)) = F_{x_m}(J̃^m(t)).
 So φ_{c_{m+1}}(t) = φ_{c_m}(t) for all small t, and both functions are holomorphic (Lemma 1). Hence φ_{c_{m+1}} ≡ φ_{c_m} on Δ by the identity theorem.
 By induction from φ_{c_1} = Y (since c_1 = i on ∂V_t), we get φ_{c_k} ≡ Y.
2. **The merge at Q_0.** Apply Lemma 2 at Q_0 to (β̃^k, c_k, x), and apply the Remark after Lemma 2 to (β̃^E, u). Then F_x(Q̃^k(t)) = Y_t.
 Let Q̃^E(t) = σ_t Q̃^k(t). The u-limit of E_t at the puncture over Q(t) is the gluing of the components in class(u) at Q̃^E(t). This class contains x, whose component is
 F_x(σ_t Q̃^k(t)) = F_{σ_t^{-1}x}(Q̃^k(t)) = F_x(Q̃^k(t)) = Y_t, by (NT).
 Q(t) is not in ξ(E_t), because H_t preserves strata and Q_0 ∉ ξ(E). So this limit is a puncture value f_u^t(p′).
3. **u is non-constant.** In the MERGE case, class(u) contains a contracted edge, and the Remark after Lemma 2 shows that u is non-constant on E_t for every t. In the puncture-MOV case (u = {x} along β̃^E), u is non-constant on E_0, so it is non-constant on E_t for all t outside a countable set, by Lemma 1(b). ∎

**Corollary A.** Combine Theorem A with chain steps 1–4 (which use L1, L2 and (O)). If Prop K's configuration at t = 0 satisfies (NT) and ends in MERGE or in puncture-MOV, then Y_t = Y_0 for all t.

Note that (NT) **fails** in the quintic example (PR-I). There P_0 = A–B–C with A ≅ C ≅ Y_0, and the symmetric chain has an automorphism exchanging A and C. That example is settled by a different, time-t Krull argument (see §5).

## 4. The twin case: a robust analysis

From now on we argue by contradiction and **assume Y is non-constant**. Let Φ be the finite family of holomorphic functions consisting of:
- Y;
- the φ_c for all pieces D at time 0 and all vertices c constant on D;
- the constant functions given by the (finitely many) components of the elements of the finite sets F(E_0,u) of L2.

Let Z ⊂ Δ be the countable set of t at which one of the following happens:
- two distinct functions of Φ take the same value;
- some vertex changes from non-constant to constant (Lemma 1(b)).

Call t ∉ Z *generic*.

**Lemma 4 (closedness of the Y-network at generic time).** Let t be generic, J ∈ closure(V_0) \ V_0, and let q ∈ Def(J) be a lift of J(t). Let β̃_t, β̃′_t be two transported lifted branches through q, i.e. sets of the form ρ·closure(Ñ_t) with ρ ∈ Aut(J). Let y be a chart vertex that is, along β̃_t, a single constant vertex c with φ_c ≡ Y. Let w be the vertex of the piece D′ of β̃′_t that contains y. Then one of the following holds.
- (a) w = {y} is a constant vertex of D′ with φ_w ≡ Y.
- (b) J(t) ∈ ξ(D′_t) is an interior point of D′_t, and w = {y} is non-constant on D′_t with pr_y(J(t)) ≅ Y_t. Call this *interior-MOV*.

In particular, (i) w never contains a contracted edge, and (ii) w is never a non-constant vertex at a puncture.

*Proof.*
- F_y(q) ≅ φ_c(t) = Y_t.
- Suppose w contains a contracted edge, or w is non-constant on D′_t with J(t) a puncture. Then Y_t is a component of a puncture value f_w^t(p), which lies in a finite set F(D′_0, w) by L2 (and L1). So Y_t equals one of the constant functions in Φ, which is impossible for generic t because Y is non-constant.
- Suppose w is constant. Then w = {y} (its limit is smooth) and φ_w(t) = Y_t. For generic t this forces φ_w ≡ Y.
- The remaining case is (b). ∎

**Theorem B (twin dichotomy).** Assume Y is non-constant. Let a junction J_m satisfy φ_{c_m} ≡ Y. Then:
- either φ_{c_{m+1}} ≡ Y;
- or there is σ ∈ Aut(J_m) with σ x_m ≠ x_m (a *twin jump*) such that, along the t = 0 branch β̃^{m+1}, the chart vertex σx_m is a single constant vertex c′ of D^{m+1} with φ_{c′} ≡ Y. The exception is an interior-MOV event at J_m.

Similarly, at Q_0: either the conclusion of (TR) holds for all generic t (impossible, since it forces Y_t into a finite set), or there is σ ∈ Aut(Q_0) with σx ≠ x such that, along β̃^E, σx is a single constant vertex of E with φ ≡ Y (again up to interior-MOV).

Hence, if Y is non-constant and there is no interior-MOV event, the Y-network performs at least one twin jump along the chain of (TR).

*Proof.*
1. Take t ∈ T_σ (Lemma 3) generic, q = J̃^m(t), β̃_t = closure(Ñ^m_t), β̃′_t = σ^{-1}closure(Ñ^{m+1}_t), and y = x_m.
2. Lemma 4 says the vertex of β̃′_t containing x_m is a Y-network constant. By (K3), that vertex is the σ^{-1}-image of the vertex of Ñ^{m+1}_t containing σx_m.
3. The pinching pattern and the vertex structure are constant along Ñ^{m+1}, so the same holds on β̃^{m+1} at t = 0.
4. If σx_m = x_m, this vertex is c_{m+1}, and φ_{c_{m+1}} ≡ Y.
5. At Q_0, run the same argument with β̃′ = σ^{-1}·(transport of β̃^E). If σx = x, the vertex containing x is u, which contradicts Lemma 4 (i)/(ii). ∎

**What a twin jump means.** At t = 0 the curve J_m has two components x_m ≠ σx_m, both isomorphic to Y_0 and exchanged by an automorphism. The marked track of Prop K continues along x_m into a constant vertex c_{m+1} with φ_{c_{m+1}} ≢ Y. The deformation, however, carries the Y-network on to the twin σx_m. For t ≠ 0 the automorphism σ no longer exists: J(t) has two different components φ_{c_m}(t) = Y_t and φ_{c_{m+1}}(t), which coincide at t = 0.

## 5. Why (TR) is not decided here: a local model and a t = 0 reformulation

**Local model (twin jump, consistent in the chart).**
- Let Def(J_0) contain coordinates (a, b) of the two Y_0-components x, y, with σ(a, b) = (b, a). Let J(t) have lifts J̃(t) = (t, −t, …) and σJ̃(t) = (−t, t, …).
- Suppose the transported D^m passes through J̃(t), with constant vertex at x of value Y_0 + t (= Y_t) and constant vertex at y of value Y_0 − t.
- Suppose the transported D^{m+1} passes through σJ̃(t), with c_{m+1} at x of value Y_0 − t, and a network vertex at y of value Y_0 + t.
- At t = 0 both branches pass through 0, and c_m, c_{m+1} both sit at x. So the hypotheses of (TR) at this junction hold.
- Lemma 4 is satisfied at every time, because D^m has a network vertex at y as well. Krull's theorem at time t gives no further constraint unless the global stratum structure is known, as in PR-I.

So no argument confined to the Kuranishi charts at the junctions can prove (TR). Any proof must use global information about how the marked Teichmüller track of Prop K sits relative to the deformation. Constructing an actual family V_t realizing this model is out of reach; I have **no counterexample**.

**How the quintic example escapes.** There the extra input is Krull at time t in Def(P_t) (PR-I Prop 3), together with the knowledge that every boundary branch near P_t lies over ∂V_t. This produces, at the same point q at time t, a branch with the opposite pinching pattern. Its network vertex lies inside the non-constant vertex of the first branch, which is the violation (ii) of Lemma 4. The general version of this observation: Krull at time t produces coherent pairs of branches (pairs through the same lift) with a prescribed pinched edge, but it does not control which pieces they belong to.

**A t = 0 statement that would suffice (MS7, open).** Call a set 𝒩 of pairs (D, c) — D a piece at time 0, c constant on D with value ≅ Y_0, containing (each component of ∂V_0, i) — **Aut-closed** if the following holds. For every J ∈ closure(V_0) \ V_0, every lifted branch β̃ at 0 ∈ Def(J) of some (D, c) ∈ 𝒩 with c = {x}, and every lifted branch β̃′ at 0 of any piece D′ through J, there is τ ∈ Aut(J) such that the vertex of D′ containing τx along β̃′ is a single constant vertex c′ with (D′, c′) ∈ 𝒩. (Interior points of D′ are included.)

- Lemma 4, transported to t = 0 as in Theorem B, shows: **if Y is non-constant and no interior-MOV event occurs, then the Y-network {(D, c) : φ_c ≡ Y} is Aut-closed.**
- So MS7 — "no Aut-closed set 𝒩 exists" — implies Y_t = Y_0, modulo the interior-MOV case.
- Prop K does not prove MS7. Its track follows the marking, which at a twin junction may continue along x_m rather than along σx_m (§4). If the track always stays inside 𝒩, Prop K does give a contradiction (Theorem A is the special case where this is automatic).



### R8-10. Theorem TV and Corollary Φ̂ (from round8_q10, verbatim, excerpts of §2 and §5)
**Corollary Φ̂ (the marked lift of the limiting disc).** Let X_n → P ∈ Δ_G, (X_n,f_n) → P̃ as in Def. FA, q_n ∈ Q(X_n) with ‖q_n‖_1 = 1 (no positive-area assumption yet). For g ∈ SL(2,R) let X^g_n, F^g_n be as in F2\*, f^g_n := F^g_n f_n. Then there is a subsequence and continuous maps φ̂_w: H = SO(2)\SL(2,R) → T(Σ_w), each 1-Lipschitz from the Poincaré metric d_H (curvature −4, d_H(SO(2)a, SO(2)b) = ½ log K(b a^{-1})) to the Teichmüller metric, such that for **every** g, (X^g_n, f^g_n) converges in T̄ to the γ_G-stratum point P̃^g with P̃^g_w = φ̂_w(g). Put φ̂ := ([φ̂_w])_w: H → Δ̂_G and φ := ξ_G∘φ̂. Then φ(g) = lim_n X^g_n in M̄_g; if (X_n,q_n) are generating pairs for V_0, φ(H) ⊂ closure(V_0) ∩ Δ_G and φ̂(H) ⊂ Â := ξ_G^{-1}(closure(V_0) ∩ Δ_G). If moreover v carries positive area η_v, then [φ̂_v(g)] = [g·(Y_v,η_v)], i.e. π_v∘φ̂ = u, where u: H → M_{g_v,n_v} is the projection of the Teichmüller disc D of (Y_v,η_v) and φ̂_v = D (as maps to T(Σ_v)).

*Proof.* (K(h) := dilatation of the affine map of derivative h; it is invariant under h ↦ k_1hk_2, k_i ∈ SO(2), so d_H is well defined; it is the hyperbolic metric of curvature −4.) Let {g_k} be a countable dense subset of SL(2,R). By F2\*(i) and a diagonal argument, pass to a subsequence along which (X^{g_k}_n, f^{g_k}_n) → P̃^{g_k} for every k. Fix k, l and w. The map F^{g_l}_n∘(F^{g_k}_n)^{-1}: X^{g_k}_n → X^{g_l}_n is affine of derivative g_lg_k^{-1} for g_k·q_n, hence K_{kl} := K(g_lg_k^{-1})-qc, and it carries the marking f^{g_k}_n to f^{g_l}_n. Lift it, with holonomies of X^{g_k}_n normalized (GC1) so that their restrictions to Γ_w converge to a holonomy σ^k_w of P̃^{g_k}_w. Lemma Lim gives a K_{kl}-qc map in the marking class from P̃^{g_k}_w onto H/R', where R' = lim of Möbius conjugates of ρ^{g_l}_n|_{Γ_w}. By (GC1) other conjugates of ρ^{g_l}_n|_{Γ_w} converge to a holonomy σ^l_w of P̃^{g_l}_w, so Lemma Conj gives R' conjugate to σ^l_w (marked). Hence d_T(P̃^{g_k}_w, P̃^{g_l}_w) ≤ ½ log K_{kl} = d_H(g_k, g_l). So g_k ↦ P̃^{g_k}_w is 1-Lipschitz on a dense set and extends (T(Σ_w) is complete) to a 1-Lipschitz φ̂_w on H. For arbitrary g, by F2\*(i) every subsequence of (X^g_n, f^g_n) has a further subsequence converging to some P̃'' in the γ_G-stratum, and the same comparison with g_k gives d_T(P̃''_w, φ̂_w(g_k)) ≤ d_H(g, g_k) for all k, so P̃''_w = φ̂_w(g) for all w. A point of the γ_G-stratum is determined by its components, so P̃'' is independent of the subsequence and (X^g_n, f^g_n) converges. The rest: T̄ → M̄_g is continuous; X^g_n ∈ V_0 by total geodesy; and φ̂_v(g) = g·(Y_v,η_v) = D(g) by F2\*(ii). ∎

So Lemma G′'s map φ exists for every G (product or not), it lifts canonically and continuously to φ̂: H → Â ⊂ Δ̂_G, and (F2) holds in the form used in Lemma T′ Step 1: π_v∘φ̂ = u. (Steps 1–3 of the proof of F2\* use only (GC1), not Def. FA; this is what the first part of the proof of Corollary Φ̂ uses.)
**Theorem TV (every boundary piece has a Teichmüller vertex).** Let G be the dual graph of a boundary stratum (any G with at least one edge, product type or not), Â := ξ_G^{-1}(closure(V_0) ∩ Δ_G) ⊂ Δ̂_G = ∏_w M_{g_w,n_w}, and E any 1-dimensional irreducible component of Â (no assumption that E meets closure(∂V_0)), with normalization ν: E^ν → E. Then there are a vertex j of G and an integrable quadratic differential η_j ≠ 0 on a curve Y_j ∈ π_j(E) such that, with D: H → T(Σ_j) the Teichmüller disc of (Y_j,η_j) and Γ′ ⊂ Aut(H) the (projectivized) Veech group:
1. C := closure of π_j(E) is a Teichmüller curve, C^ν = H/Γ′, and Γ′ is a lattice;
2. p := π_j∘ν: E^ν → C^ν is **proper** and E^ν ≅ H/Λ_E for a subgroup Λ_E ⊂ Γ′ of index deg p;
3. **orbifold structure**: give E^ν the orbifold structure of H/Λ_E, i.e. a point e over an orbifold point of C^ν of order m, at which p has local degree k, gets order m/k (k always divides m). Then p is an orbifold covering (orbifold-unramified), and the lift of π_j∘ν to orbifold universal covers is D, an isometric holomorphic embedding onto the Teichmüller disc, equivariant for Λ_E → Mod(Σ_j);
4. E is not compact, and every end of E^ν maps to a cusp of C (so along every end of E the j-component degenerates).
For product-type G (the case of the problem's Δ_Γ), Â = closure(V_0) ∩ Δ_G and ξ_G = id.

*Proof.* Pick P̂ ∈ E outside the finite set Sing Â ∪ (E ∩ other components) and outside the discrete exceptional set of PR-H Lemma PA, and let P = ξ_G(P̂). Lemma PA (PR-H, quoted; its proof is local in the plumbing chart at P, an orbifold chart of M̄_g whose fibres carry a labelling of components by V(G), hence it applies at P̂ ∈ Δ̂_G; and it uses only a ≠ 0 at P̂, true off a discrete set) gives generating pairs (X_n,q_n), ‖q_n‖ = 1, X_n → P along the branch of closure(V_0) through P̂, and a vertex j with q_j ≢ 0 (it maximizes the Teichmüller norm of the j-component of the tangent vector a of E at P̂). Lemma TR turns this into "j carries positive area" (Def. FA, η_j := q_j integrable, ∫|η_j| ≤ 1). Corollary Φ̂ gives φ̂: H → Â with φ̂(i) = P̂ (the labelled lift defined by the plumbing markings is P̂) and π_j∘φ̂ = u. Steps 2′, 3′, 4′, 5 of §4 then give 1–4; Step 2′ produces the component through φ̂(i) = P̂, which is E by the choice of P̂. ∎

**Caveats on item 3 (stated precisely).**
- The orbifold structure in (3) is the one *induced by Λ_E*; I have **not** shown that it coincides with the orbifold structure E inherits as a curve in the orbifold Δ̂_G (or M̄_g). They agree away from the finitely many points over orbifold points of C. If one prefers to avoid orbifolds, pass to a level-m cover: replace Γ′ by the torsion-free Γ′_m := π_1(C'^ν) and E^ν by a component of the fibre product E^ν ×_{C^ν} C'^ν normalized; then p becomes a genuine unramified finite covering of Riemann surfaces and the lift to universal covers is again D.
- Lemma PA is quoted, not re-proved, and in the non-product case its applicability on Δ̂_G rests on the labelled plumbing chart (Pl), which I have only described.
- The map φ̂ depends on the chosen subsequence; Theorem TV does not.

## 2. Lemma U (uniformity under (Rig)) — proved

**Lemma U.** Assume (R1), (R2) and (Rig). Let W be a 2-dimensional irreducible component of 𝓦_G. There are a set M_W ⊂ V(G) and an irreducible closed curve K_W ⊂ ∏_{u∈M_W} M̄_u, not contained in the boundary, with the following property. For **every** t ∈ Δ and **every** 1-dimensional component D of W_t:
- M(D) = M_W and K(D) = K_W;
- every vertex u ∉ M_W is constant on D;
- D = K_W × {c_D} for a point c_D ∈ ∏_{u∉M_W} M_u.

*Proof.*

**Step 1 (generic moving set).** Let n: W^ν → W be the normalization, a normal surface. Let W^ν →a T →b Δ be the Stein factorization of t∘n, which is proper. T is a normal, hence smooth, curve and b is finite.
- **Critical values are discrete.** Let C be an irreducible curve of critical points of a on W^ν_reg. Then d(a|_C) = 0, so a is constant on C. The singular points of W^ν are isolated. Hence the set of critical values of a (images of Sing W^ν, of isolated critical points, and of critical curves) is discrete in T.
- **Generic fibres are irreducible.** For τ ∈ T outside a discrete set, a^{-1}(τ) is a smooth, compact, connected curve, hence irreducible.
- **Fibres of W.** Since n is finite and surjective, for every t, W_t = ⋃_{τ ∈ b^{-1}(t)} n(a^{-1}(τ)). Every component of W_t is the image of a component of some a^{-1}(τ). For generic t the components of W_t are exactly the irreducible curves n(a^{-1}(τ)), τ ∈ b^{-1}(t).
- **The dichotomy for a vertex u.** Put Φ_u := (pr_u∘n, a): W^ν → M̄_u × T and R_u := {x : dim_x Φ_u^{-1}Φ_u(x) ≥ 1}, which is analytic by Cartan–Remmert.
  - If R_u = W^ν: let K be a component of a fibre a^{-1}(τ) and x ∈ K a point on no other component. The Φ_u-fibre through x lies in a^{-1}(τ) and is 1-dimensional at x, so it contains the germ of K at x. Hence pr_u is constant on K. So u is constant on every component of every fibre of a, and therefore on every component of every W_t.
  - If R_u ≠ W^ν: then dim R_u ≤ 1. Every fibre component on which pr_u is constant lies in R_u, and the components of R_u are locally finite. So this happens only for τ in a discrete subset of T.
- Put M_W := {u : R_u ≠ W^ν}. Then for t outside a discrete set Z_W ⊂ Δ, every component of W_t has moving set exactly M_W. For every t and every component of W_t, every u ∉ M_W is constant on it. M_W ≠ ∅, since components of W_t are curves.

**Step 2 (one image curve).** Let Σ := (pr_{M_W}, t)(W) ⊂ ∏_{u∈M_W} M̄_u × Δ. It is closed, analytic and irreducible (Remmert; the map is proper on W). It has dimension 2, since t is non-constant on it and its generic fibres are curves.
- For t ∉ Z_W and a component D of W_t, pr_{M_W}(D) is the closure of the image of the piece, i.e. K(D).
- By (Rig), K(D) belongs to the finite list {α^{-1}K : α ∈ Aut(G), (G, αM_W, K) ∈ 𝒦}, with factors relabelled by α. Call its members K_1, …, K_N.
- So Σ ∩ {t ∉ Z_W} ⊂ ⋃_j K_j × Δ, and by closedness Σ ⊂ ⋃_j K_j × Δ.
- Σ is irreducible of dimension 2, so it lies in one K_j × Δ, and equals it since both are irreducible of dimension 2. Put K_W := K_j.
- For each u ∈ M_W, pr_u|_{K_W} is non-constant, because K_W = K(D) for a generic-time component D with u ∈ M(D).

**Step 3 (all times).** Let t be arbitrary and D a component of W_t.
- By Step 1 the vertices outside M_W are constant on D. So D ⊂ pr_{M_W}^{-1}(pr_{M_W}(D)) ∩ {coordinates outside M_W constant}.
- pr_{M_W}(D) ⊂ Σ_t = K_W is closed and irreducible, so it is a point or all of K_W. If it were a point, every coordinate would be constant on the curve D, which is absurd.
- So pr_{M_W}(D) = K_W. Every u ∈ M_W is non-constant on D (end of Step 2), so M(D) = M_W and K(D) = K_W.
- D is an irreducible curve inside the irreducible curve K_W × {c_D}, so the two are equal. Here c_D ∈ ∏ M_u, because D is the closure of a subset of ∏_w M_w and the coordinates of c_D are constant on D. ∎

**Corollaries.**
- **U1 (L1′ with its converse; no non-product pathology).** For each W and vertex u, the following are equivalent:
  - u is constant on one component of one fibre;
  - u ∉ M_W;
  - u is constant on all components of all fibres.

  In particular the situation of R7-5 §1.4 (u constant on E_0 but non-constant on σE_0 inside the same W) cannot occur under (Rig). Consequently, for a component W' through a point p obtained from W by ρ ∈ Aut(G): M_{ρW} = ρM_W and K_{ρW} = ρK_W.
- **U2 (t-independent image curves; the earlier worker's Lemma 6, repaired).** The partial file's Lemma 6 asserts that "M is the same for all t by L1′". L1′ gives only one direction, and for non-product G the fibres of W can have components with different moving sets unless (Rig) is used as above. Lemma U is the correct statement.
- **U3 (puncture values).** For each W, the values pr_{M_W}(ν(p)) at punctures p of components of W_t lie in K_W ∩ ∂(∏ M̄_u). This is a finite set independent of t.
- **U4 (constant-vertex value curves).** For u ∉ M_W, Γ_{W,u} := (pr_u, t)(W) is an irreducible curve, finite over Δ. Its fibre over t is the set of values of u on the components of W_t.

## 3. Generic times and the trichotomy (Theorem 1) — proved

From now on assume, for contradiction, that **Y is non-constant**. Y: Δ → 𝔐 is holomorphic by PR-A, so its graph is an irreducible curve.

**The finite set 𝔉 ⊂ 𝔐 (independent of t).**
- Let 𝒫_1 be the set of points of K ∩ ∂(∏_{u∈M} M̄_u), over all (G, M, K) ∈ 𝒦 and all Aut(G)-relabellings. It is finite: K is an irreducible compact curve not contained in the boundary.
- Let A_1 be the set of classes of the smooth components, with their special points, of all coordinates of points of 𝒫_1.
- Let 𝒫_2 be the set of points κ ∈ K such that the class of some coordinate pr_z(κ), z ∈ M, lies in A_1. It is finite, because pr_z|_K is non-constant for z ∈ M (Lemma U).
- Let 𝔉 be the set of classes of the smooth components of all coordinates of the points of 𝒫_1 ∪ 𝒫_2.

**The set Z.** Z is the set of t ∈ Δ such that one of the following holds:
- Y_t ∈ 𝔉;
- (Y_t, t) lies on the image in 𝔐 × Δ of some curve Γ_{W,u} (u ∉ M_W, M_u of type (g_i,n_i)) that is not the graph of Y.

Each W, and each such pair (W,u), contributes a discrete set: in the first case because Y is non-constant, in the second because two distinct irreducible curves meet discretely. The components W are locally finite over Δ. Hence **Z is discrete** in Δ.

Call a pair (W,u) with Γ_{W,u} ↦ graph(Y) a **Y-vertex**.

**Theorem 1.** Let t ∉ Z, Q ∈ B_t, q a lift of Q in Def(Q), and y a Y_t-copy of q (comp_y(q) ≅ Y_t). Let b̃ be a lifted branch through q of a branch b of B_t at Q. Let E be the piece of b at time t, with graph G_b and component W ⊃ E. Then exactly one of the following holds.
- **(STAY)** Every edge at y is pinched along b̃, y is a constant vertex of E, and (W, y) is a Y-vertex.
- **(IMOV)** Q is an interior point of E (so Q ∈ Δ_{G_b}), and y ∈ M_W. Moreover, for every z ∈ M_W and every other lifted branch b̃′ through q, z is neither merged along b̃′ nor non-constant at a puncture along b̃′.

In particular, a Y_t-copy is never merged along a branch (**MERGE excluded**), and never intact and non-constant at a puncture (**puncture-MOV excluded**).

*Proof.*
1. **Merge.** Suppose some edge at y is unpinched along b̃. By R7-1 Lemma 1(a) (= R7-4 Lemma 1), the point p of Ē over Q is a puncture, the vertex u ∋ y of G_b is non-constant, and comp_y(q) is a component, with the same special points, of f_u(p).
   - By Lemma U, u ∈ M_W and pr_{M_W}ν(p) ∈ 𝒫_1.
   - So Y_t ∈ A_1 ⊂ 𝔉, contradicting t ∉ Z.
2. **Puncture-move.** Suppose y is intact, {y} is non-constant, and Q ∉ Δ_{G_b}. Then p is a puncture and f_y(p) = comp_y(q) (R7-1 Lemma 1(b)). So Y_t ∈ A_1, again a contradiction.
3. **Constant.** Suppose y is intact and constant on E. Its value is comp_y(q) ≅ Y_t, so (Y_t, t) lies on the image of Γ_{W,y}. Since t ∉ Z, Γ_{W,y} maps onto graph(Y): this is STAY.
4. **Remaining case.** Here y is intact and non-constant, and Q ∈ Δ_{G_b}. So y ∈ M_W, and κ := pr_{M_W}(lift of Q) ∈ K_W.
   - Suppose some z ∈ M_W were merged, or moving at a puncture, along another branch b̃′ through q. Then, as in 1–2, comp_z(q) = pr_z(κ) has class in A_1. So κ ∈ 𝒫_2, and Y_t ≅ pr_y(κ) lies in 𝔉, a contradiction. ∎

**Remark.** Theorem 1 never compares two copies. At a generic t, *every* Y_t-copy obeys it, whatever the automorphisms of Q. Twins matter only when information is transported between t = 0 (where total geodesy is available) and generic t. That is the subject of §4.


### R8-3 (excerpt). Corollary T (from round8_q3, verbatim, §4.1; it uses Theorem N, which is R8-2 Theorem 1 in another form)
## 4. Consequences

### 4.1 Corollary T (twin criterion under (Rig); no (O), no Lock, no restriction on automorphisms)

Let J ∈ closure(∂V_0) \ ∂V_0 lie in Δ_{G′}. Let 𝒞 and j(S) be as in PR-I Theorem 4. Assume:
- (Tw1) there is a neighbourhood U of J with B_0 ∩ U ⊂ ∂V_0 ∪ {J};
- (Mg) for all S ≠ S′ in 𝒞, some edge at j(S) is not in S′.

Then MS8 holds: Y_t = Y_0 for all t.

*Proof.*
1. Suppose Y is non-constant and take t generic. Put J_t := H_t(J) ∈ closure(∂V_t), and let q be a lift of J_t.
2. A branch of ∂V_t at J_t lifts to a branch β̃ through q, with pattern S ∈ 𝒞. By Lemma D(1) of PR-I, y := j(S) is intact and comp_y(q) ≅ Y_t.
3. J_t ∉ Δ_Γ, so there is an edge e ∉ S. Let X be an irreducible component, at q, of the preimage of closure(V_t) containing β̃.
   - s_e is not identically 0 on X, since it is nonzero on β̃ \ q.
   - So X ∩ {s_e = 0} is pure 1-dimensional through q (Krull). It contains a branch b̃ ≠ β̃ with e ∈ S_b̃.
4. By (Tw1), transported by H_t, b̃ lies over ∂V_t. So S′ := S_b̃ ∈ 𝒞, and S′ ≠ S because e ∈ S′ \ S.
5. By (Mg), y is merged along b̃. This contradicts Theorem N. ∎

**Remarks.**
- This is PR-I Proposition 3 / Theorem 4 with (O), (Tw2)(iii) and all Teichmüller-curve input replaced by (Rig).
- It holds whether or not Aut(J) swaps the twins. Theorem N concerns every copy at the same lift q, so the identity of "the" tracked copy never enters.
- In the quintic example, 𝒞 = {{e_1},{e_2}}, j({e_1}) = A has e_1 ∉ {e_2}, and symmetrically. So (Mg) holds.


### R8-4. Lemma P, Lemma G, Corollary G1, Theorem 2V, crossings, twin jumps under (Rig), why no counterexample was found (from round8_q4, verbatim, §§1–6)
## 1. Notation; the finite sets F′, F″ fixed by (Rig)

**Labels and charts.**
- For R ∈ B_t := closure(V_t) \ V_t, let Def(R) be the versal deformation germ, with smoothing parameters s_e, e ∈ E(G_R).
- The labels ℓ ∈ V(G_R) name the components R_ℓ of R. Each R_ℓ carries as special points its node branches.
- A lifted branch b̃ ⊂ Def(R) through 0 of a 1-dimensional branch b of B_t at R has a constant pattern S_b = {e : s_e ≡ 0 on b̃}.
- b is a *boundary branch* if R is not in the stratum of b. Then R corresponds to a puncture p of the piece E containing b, lifted by b̃ (R7-4 Lemma 1, step 1).
- The label ℓ is *merged* along b̃ if some edge at ℓ is not in S_b, and *intact* otherwise.
- [ℓ] denotes the vertex of the piece's graph G_b = G_R/(E∖S_b) that contains ℓ.

**The set F′.** For (G, M, K) ∈ 𝒦:
- K ∩ ∂(∏_{u∈M} M̄_u) is finite, because K is an irreducible closed curve not contained in the boundary.
- Let F′ be the set of isomorphism classes, as pointed curves with unordered special points, of the smooth irreducible components of the curves pr_u(z), for z ∈ K ∩ ∂, u ∈ M, (G, M, K) ∈ 𝒦.
- F′ is finite and does not depend on t.

**The set F″.** For (G, M, K) ∈ 𝒦, u, x ∈ M, and each of the finitely many points m ∈ M_u whose class lies in F′:
- pr_u|_K is non-constant, because u ∈ M is a non-constant vertex and K is the closure of the image of the piece. So K ∩ pr_u^{-1}(m) is finite.
- Let F″ be the set of classes of pr_x(k) for all such k (when pr_x(k) is a smooth curve). F″ is finite.

**Generic times.**
- t ↦ Y_t is holomorphic (PR-A), and so is its composition with the finite map to the coarse space M_{g_i,n_i}/S_{n_i}.
- If Y is non-constant, Z := {t : class(Y_t) ∈ F′ ∪ F″} is discrete in Δ. Call t ∉ Z *generic*.

**Lemma P (puncture values).** Let b be a boundary branch at R ∈ B_t with lift b̃ and piece E. Let ℓ be a label that is merged along b̃, or intact with [ℓ] = {ℓ} ∈ M(E). Then class(R_ℓ) ∈ F′.

*Proof.*
1. ν(p) ∉ ∏_w M_w, since p is a puncture.
2. Vertices w ∉ M(E) are constant, with values in M_w.
3. Hence z := pr_{M(E)} ν(p) ∈ K(E) ∩ ∂, and (G_b, M(E), K(E)) ∈ 𝒦 up to Aut(G_b).
4. If ℓ is merged, f_{[ℓ]}(p) = pr_{[ℓ]}(z) is the curve glued from the R_y, y ∈ [ℓ], along the unpinched edges. R_ℓ is a component of it, with the same special points (R7-1 Lemma 1(a)).
5. If ℓ is intact and non-constant, f_ℓ(p) = R_ℓ (R7-1 Lemma 1(b)).
6. In both cases [ℓ] ∈ M(E) is forced: a merged vertex has a nodal limit, so it is non-constant (PR-C, Lemma C2). Hence class(R_ℓ) ∈ F′. ∎

## 2. Lemma G (generic-time exclusion) — proved

**Lemma G.** Assume (Rig) and that Y is non-constant. Let t be generic, R ∈ B_t, and ℓ ∈ V(G_R) with R_ℓ ≅ Y_t. Then for every boundary branch b at R and every lift b̃:
- ℓ is intact along b̃;
- {ℓ} is a constant vertex of the piece of b, with value R_ℓ.

At generic t, therefore, a Y_t-copy never merges and never moves at a puncture. The only remaining way for it to move is along a branch whose stratum contains R ("interior-MOV").

*Proof.* Otherwise Lemma P gives class(Y_t) = class(R_ℓ) ∈ F′, contradicting genericity. ∎

**Corollary G1 (merging copies are frozen).** Let R ∈ B_0 and t ↦ q(t) a continuous lift of R_t := H_t(R) into the chart Def(R) (at R, i.e. at t = 0). Suppose that for all t in a connected set T ∋ 0 the label c is merged along some lifted boundary branch through q(t). Then class(comp_c(q(t))) is constant on T.

*Proof.* By Lemma P (applied in the chart at R_t, whose labels are induced from those at R because H_t preserves strata), the class lies in the finite set F′ and is continuous in t. ∎

So for every merge configuration supplied at t = 0 (Proposition K, or the admissible-cover merges for covering constructions), the merged Y_0-copy keeps the fixed class Y_0 at all small t. If Y is non-constant, it is therefore not a Y_t-copy, and the merge point must carry a *second* component ≅ Y_t: a twin. **Every counterexample to MS8 must contain twins at all such merge points.**

## 3. Theorem 2V (a sufficient criterion: (Rig) ⇒ Y constant) — proved

**Combinatorial notation.**
- Let P_0 ∈ closure(∂V_0) \ ∂V_0, with dual graph G′.
- As in PR-I, let 𝒞 be the set of S ⊂ E(G′) such that contracting E(G′) \ S gives a graph identified with Γ in which the preimage of i is a single loop-free vertex j(S).
- Let 𝒞_j := {S ∈ 𝒞 : j(S) = j}.

**Theorem 2V.** Assume (R1), (R2), (Rig) and the problem's hypotheses. Suppose that there is P_0 ∈ closure(∂V_0) \ ∂V_0 such that:
- **(Tw1)** for some neighbourhood U of P_0, (closure(V_0) \ V_0) ∩ U ⊂ ∂V_0 ∪ {P_0};
- **(C1)** on every component E_0 of ∂V_0 with P_0 ∈ closure(E_0), the only constant vertex is i;
- **(C2)** for every S ∈ 𝒞 there is an edge e ∈ E(G′) \ S that lies in no S′ ∈ 𝒞_{j(S)}.

Then Y_t = Y_0 for all t.

**Special case.** If Γ has exactly two vertices i and u, then (C1) is automatic: u must be non-constant, because dim ∂V_t = 1. (C2) is also automatic: 𝒞_j = {edges at j}, since every edge not contracted joins the two blocks (Γ has no loops, being of product type), and S ≠ E(G′) because P_0 ∉ Δ_Γ. So **(Tw1) at one cusp of ∂V_0 suffices when |V(Γ)| = 2.** No totally-geodesic input, no (O) and no Teichmüller-vertex input is needed beyond (Rig).

*Proof.* Suppose Y is non-constant.
1. **Excluded times.** Let Z_1 be the countable set of t at which some vertex that is non-constant on a component E_0 as in (C1) becomes constant on E_t := H_t(E_0). Its countability is R7-3 Lemma 1(b), a prior result; I re-read its rank argument and accept it. Fix t ∉ Z ∪ Z_1; such t exist.
2. **The transported cusp.** Put P_t := H_t(P_0).
   - P_t ∈ closure(∂V_t) \ ∂V_t.
   - G_{P_t} = G′, since strata are preserved.
   - Near P_t, B_t ⊂ ∂V_t ∪ {P_t}, because H_t(U ∩ closure V_0) is a neighbourhood of P_t in closure(V_t), mapped stratum-wise.
3. **The germ.** Work in Def(P_t). Let S̃ be the preimage of the germ of closure(V_t). It is analytic by (R1) and pure 2-dimensional.
4. **The first branch.** Take a lifted branch β̃ of ∂V_t through 0, lying in a component E_t.
   - By PR-I Lemma D(1), S_β ∈ 𝒞, and j := j(S_β) has P_{t,j} ≅ Y_t.
   - Every other label ℓ lies in the block of a vertex w ≠ i. By (C1) and t ∉ Z_1, w ∈ M(E_t). So by Lemma P (P_t is a puncture of E_t), class(P_{t,ℓ}) ∈ F′ ∌ class(Y_t).
   - **Hence j is the unique Y_t-copy of P_t.**
5. **Krull.** By (C2) choose e ∉ S_β lying in no element of 𝒞_j. Let X be an irreducible component of S̃ containing β̃.
   - s_e is not identically zero on X (it is nonzero on β̃ \ 0), and s_e(0) = 0. So X ∩ {s_e = 0} is pure 1-dimensional at 0.
   - Its points lie in ∂M̄_g, hence in B_t. By step 2, any branch b̃ of it lies over ∂V_t off 0.
   - b̃ ≠ β̃.
6. **The second branch.** By Lemma D(1), S_b ∈ 𝒞, and the label j(S_b) is a Y_t-copy. By step 4, j(S_b) = j, so S_b ∈ 𝒞_j. But e ∈ S_b, which contradicts the choice of e. ∎

**Remarks.**
- This is PR-I Theorem 4 with (Rig) in place of (O) and the Teichmüller-curve assumption. (C2) replaces (Tw2): with (Rig), a twin of Y_t inside any non-constant block is impossible at generic t.
- Theorem 2V applies to covering constructions over M_{0,5} with a 2-vertex Γ whenever, at some image cusp, all boundary branches lie in Δ_Γ. An example is the S_5-symmetric quintic of PR-I, but that one is not smooth.
- Hence **a counterexample must have, at every cusp of ∂V_0, either a boundary piece outside Δ_Γ (failure of (Tw1)), or (C1)/(C2) failing.**

## 4. Crossings under (Rig): Lemma X — proved

**Lemma X.** Assume Y is non-constant and t ∉ Z. Let R ∈ B_t be an interior point of a piece D, given by a lift d̃ ⊂ Def(R) with S_d = E(G_R), so that G_D = G_R as labelled graphs. Let x ∈ M(D) with R_x ≅ Y_t. Then for every boundary branch b at R, every lift b̃, and every u ∈ M(D) (including u = x):
- u is intact along b̃;
- {u} is a constant vertex of b's piece.

*Proof.*
1. Suppose not for some u. Lemma P gives class(R_u) ∈ F′, so R_u ∈ M_u is one of finitely many points m.
2. The point k := (R_w)_{w∈M(D)} lies in K(D), since it is the M(D)-projection of the point of D̂ over R.
3. pr_u(k) = m, so k ∈ K(D) ∩ pr_u^{-1}(m), a finite set.
4. Hence class(Y_t) = class(pr_x(k)) ∈ F″, contradicting t ∉ Z. ∎

**Consequences for a crossing at generic t.** Let R_t be an interior-MOV point, i.e. a point where the Y-network passes from a STAY piece D′ into a piece D on which the Y_t-copy x moves.
- **(X1) Y moves inside a fixed curve.** Y_t = pr_x(k_t) with k_t ∈ K(D). So Y_t ∈ closure(pr_x(K(D))) =: C_x, a fixed irreducible curve in M̄_{g_i,n_i}, for all t in a set accumulating at 0. Hence **Y(Δ) ⊂ C_x**: Y is a holomorphic disc in a fixed curve. If x is a maximal-speed vertex at t = 0, C_x is a Teichmüller curve (Lemma PA plus PR-F, modulo (F2)).
- **(X2) Orthogonality.** Along every boundary branch at R_t, all of M(D) is frozen into constant singleton vertices. Moreover the constant-vertex functions c′_u(t) of D′ (u ∈ M(D)) satisfy the algebraic relation (c′_u(t))_{u∈M(D)} ∈ K(D) for all t.
- **(X3) Survival.** The local model of R7-2 §4.2 satisfies (X1)–(X2) at every t:
  - smooth germ (σ, ρ), with s_e = ρσ for the edges at x and s_f = ρ for the others;
  - the x-coordinate is σ + κ(t), and {σ = 0} is the STAY piece, where the other components are smoothed into one moving block;
  - D = {ρ = 0}, with M(D) = {x}.

  This model has M(D) = {x}, so (X2) only says that x is constant along the STAY piece, which holds. Neither (Rig) nor Lemma G excludes it. It is excluded only if some u ∈ M(D) \ {x} sits in a moving block of some boundary branch at R_t.

## 5. Twin jumps under (Rig) — tested

**Model.** The R7-3 §5 model:
- a junction J with Y_0-copies x, y = σx, σ ∈ Aut(J_0);
- D^m through J̃(t) with x ↦ Y_t and y ↦ Y′_t (both constant vertices);
- D^{m+1} through σJ̃(t) with x ↦ Y′_t and y ↦ Y_t.

**Checks.**
- (Rig) constrains only non-constant vertices, and all vertices involved are constant. So **(Rig) is satisfied**, for any holomorphic Y′ with Y′(0) = Y_0.
- **Lemma G is satisfied at every generic t.**
  - At J̃(t) the unique Y_t-copy is x.
  - Along the lift σ^{-1}·(D^{m+1}-branch) through J̃(t), the vertex containing x corresponds, by (K3), to the vertex of D^{m+1} containing σx = y. That vertex is constant ≡ Y.
  - So the Y-network is consistent. Twin jumps per se survive.
- **Where a twin jump is constrained.** Combine with Corollary G1: Prop K's track ends at a MERGE point Q_0 whose merged label γc is frozen (class Y_0 for all small t). The network copy at Q_t is a different label with class Y_t. So a counterexample built on twin jumps needs:
  - **(T1)** a junction J_0 ∈ B_0 with two Y_0-copies exchanged by an automorphism of the stable curve J_0;
  - **(T2)** at the end point Q_0 at least two Y_0-copies: one that merges along the Prop K branch and keeps class Y_0 for all t, and one carried by STAY pieces with class Y_t;
  - **(T3)** by §3, the boundary near Q_0 is not of the form (Tw1) with (C1), (C2). So a second piece outside Δ_Γ passes through Q_0, or another constant vertex is present, or the combinatorics defeat (C2).

  For Galois covering constructions, (T1)/(T2) are typical, because deck transformations act on boundary curves and permute the components over a given base component. So these examples cannot be excluded by the present tools unless (Tw1)+(C1)+(C2) hold at some cusp.

## 6. Why no counterexample and no easy proof

**(i) No easy proof from (Rig).**
- (Rig) constrains only the non-constant parts K(E). The constant-vertex values, which include Y_t and all its twins, are unconstrained holomorphic functions of t (L1′, R7-3 Lemma 1).
- The two local models above (twin jump, orthogonal crossing) satisfy (Rig), Lemma G, Lemma X and Krull at time t, at every t.
- So any proof of MS8 must use global t = 0 information (total geodesy of V_0) and transport it in a way that survives twins and crossings. This is the open problem MS7 / Open Questions 1–2 of R7-2.
- The concrete form that suffices is Theorem 2V, or R7-4 Theorem 3 (TM).

**(ii) No counterexample.**
- A counterexample needs an explicit holomorphic, smoothly trivial family V_t ⊂ M_g of surfaces that are *not* totally geodesic for t ≠ 0. Its boundary must be controlled stratum by stratum ((R2)), and it must satisfy the global constraints of §§3–5.
- The only explicit 2-dimensional subvarieties of M_g whose boundary I can compute are covering constructions and the flex/gothic loci (cited from memory). These are rigid as totally geodesic subvarieties.
- I know no construction of non-totally-geodesic deformations with controlled boundary. Note that V_t must change complex structure, since log vector fields near closure(V_0) are tangent to V_0 (other files of this run).
- Hence (a) was not achieved and (b) gives nothing.

### R8-5 (excerpt). Proposition D: what a twin jump requires (from round8_q5, verbatim, §6)
## 6. The residual case: what a twin jump requires (partly proved, partly open)

**Proposition D (necessary conditions for a twin jump; proved, given (TD_J)).** Suppose φ_{c_{k−1}} ≢ φ_{c_k} at the junction J. Then:
- (a) (Lock_J) fails, and (U_J) fails. So there is α ∈ Γ ∖ KΓ_x (in particular αx ≠ x, and α is not a generic automorphism of the family) with (0,0) ∈ closure(Fix(α) ∩ 𝒞°): curves of V_τ near J, with |τ| arbitrarily small, have an automorphism (induced by α ∈ Aut(J)) that exchanges the tracked region x with a different region αx.
- (b) Let Φ be an irreducible component, through (0,0), of the analytic germ Fix(α) ∩ closure(𝒞°) ⊂ Def(J) × Δ that is not contained in {∏ s_e = 0}. One of the following holds:
  - **(A)** Φ ∩ {τ = 0} contains points of B° near 0, arbitrarily close to 0. That is: curves of V_0 itself, arbitrarily close to J, admit an automorphism (from Aut(J) acting on Def(J)) that moves x.
  - **(B)** Φ ∩ {τ = 0} ⊂ {∏ s_e = 0} and has dimension ≥ 1. That is: some lifted branch of B_0 at J (lying in closure(𝒞°)) is fixed pointwise by α. Then every boundary point of V_0 on that branch has an automorphism exchanging the components (or merged vertices) containing x and αx.
  - **(C)** dim Φ = 1 and Φ ∩ {τ = 0} = {(0,0)}. That is: there is a holomorphic arc τ ↦ C_τ ∈ V_τ (after a base change τ = σ^k) of smooth curves with automorphism α, converging to J as τ → 0. This is invisible at t = 0.

*Proof.*
- (a) is the contrapositive of Theorem A, together with R7-1 Step 2 for (Lock). For the germ reformulation of (U_J), see (C3).
- (b) closure(𝒞°) is a 3-dimensional analytic set. It is the closure of a connected component of the preimage of the 3-dimensional manifold 𝒱 (R1); closures of unions of components of q^{-1}(𝒱_U) are analytic, as in R7-4 Lemma 2(c). Fix(α) = Fix_{Def(J)}(α) × Δ is a smooth submanifold (linear action). So Fix(α) ∩ closure(𝒞°) is analytic, and Φ has dimension 1, 2 or 3.
  - **dim 3.** Then α fixes 𝒞° pointwise, i.e. α ∈ K ⊂ KΓ_x, contradicting the choice of α. So this case does not occur.
  - **dim Φ ≥ 2.** Φ ∩ {τ = 0} has dimension ≥ 1 at (0,0) (Krull, if τ ≢ 0 on Φ; trivially otherwise). It lies in closure(𝒞°) ∩ {τ=0} ⊂ q^{-1}(closure(V_0) ∩ U), by (R2): H commutes with closures and H_0 = id. Either it meets B° arbitrarily close to 0, giving (A), or it lies in the boundary, giving (B).
  - **dim 1.** If Φ ⊂ {τ = 0}, then Φ ∖ (0,0) consists of interior points of V_0's lift, giving (A). Otherwise τ|_Φ is finite at (0,0), and since Φ ⊄ {∏s_e = 0}, Φ ∖ (0,0) ⊂ B° × Δ near (0,0) (a proper analytic subset of an irreducible curve germ is the point). This is (C), with the normalisation of Φ giving the base change. ∎

**How this relates to the planner's dichotomy (step 5(b) of the sketch, and the "named approach").**
- The first alternative, "Fix(α) ∩ 𝓛 stays away from the region swept by the transported paths", is (U_J). Under it, Theorem A makes R7-6's argument rigorous at J.
- The second alternative, "the closure of the fixed locus meets the boundary at points J′_τ near J_τ at which α exchanges two components both ≅ Y_τ", is **not** forced by the analysis above. In case (C), Φ meets the boundary only at (0,0). In case (B), it meets it only at τ = 0.
- Even when Φ ∩ {∏s_e = 0} contains an arc Ψ with τ|_Ψ non-constant, the point ψ(τ) ∈ Ψ may be:
  - a lift ĵ(τ) of J(τ). Then F_x(ĵ(τ)) = F_{αx}(ĵ(τ)): the twins are locked at that particular lift, which is a pointwise form of (Lock).
  - a point of a lifted transported branch Z. Then only the components x, αx of that boundary point are exchanged.

  In neither case did I find a way to show that the monodromy κ of the square (a product of conjugates of such α's) fixes the class F_x on the transported D'-branch. Heuristically (this is not a construction), the R7-3 §5 local model, completed by an interior 3-fold, is compatible with (C). Take Def coordinates (a, b) for the two twin components with σ(a,b) = (b,a), and let 𝒞̄ be any irreducible 3-fold containing both transported branches and meeting Fix(σ) = {a = b} in a curve through (0,0) only.

So the chart-plus-interior-local analysis does not exclude (C) either. Any proof of (TW) must use total geodesy at t = 0, or global information, to exclude (A), (B) and (C) at a twin junction, or to show that they force (Lock).

**Remark (where total geodesy could enter, not carried out).** In case (A), the lift of V_0 and Fix(α) are both totally geodesic in T_g. Fix(α) is the image of the Teichmüller space of the quotient orbifold, a holomorphic isometric embedding. So their intersection near the lift of J is a totally geodesic subvariety of V_0 consisting of α-symmetric curves, whose closure contains J. One would want to show that such a sub-locus forces the twins x, αx to stay isomorphic at J(τ) under every deformation satisfying (i), (ii). That would be a (Lock) statement, and it is the natural next target. I have no proof.


### R8-8. Theorem 1, isotropy preservation, Proposition 3 (from round8_q8, verbatim, §§0–4)
## 0. Conventions and inputs

All of the following are adopted verbatim from the task: readings (R1) and (R2) with H_0 = id, B_t := closure(V_t) \ V_t, "piece", ν, puncture, f_u, M(E), K(E), and (Rig).

- For a stable curve J, Def(J) is its versal deformation germ, with smoothing parameters s_e (e ∈ E(G_J)). Aut(J) acts on Def(J), and π: Def(J) → Def(J)/Aut(J) is a neighbourhood of J in M̄_g.
- For a vertex x put L_x := {s_e = 0 for all edges e at x}. F_x: L_x → M_{g_x,n_x} is the x-component of the fibre curve.
- Facts (K1)–(K3) of R7-3 §1 are used. Cited from memory as standard:
  - (K1) the preimage of a point is one Aut(J)-orbit;
  - (K3) F_x(σq) ≅ F_{σ^{-1}x}(q).
- (K4) (standard, from memory; the local structure of the Deligne–Mumford stack M̄_g = [Def(J)/Aut(J)] near J) For q ∈ Def(J) close to 0, Aut(fibre curve at q) ≅ Stab_{Aut(J)}(q). Hence for J′ near J,
  #π^{-1}(J′) = |Aut(J)| / |Aut(J′)|.
- "≅" between pointed curves always means: isomorphic after some relabelling of the special points. Equivalently, the images [·] in the coarse space M_{g_i,n_i}/S_{n_i}, which is a reduced complex analytic space, are equal.

**Transport families** (R7-3 Lemma 2, R7-4 Lemma 2; I re-checked the steps used).
- Let J ∈ B_0, and let β̃ be a lifted branch at 0 ∈ Def(J) of a piece D. Either J is a puncture of D, or J lies on D and β̃ is the lifted germ of D.
- Put N := H((β \ {J}) × Δ_ε), and let Ñ be the connected component of π^{-1}(N) ⊂ Def(J) × Δ_ε that contains β̃ \ {0}.
- Then the pinched-edge pattern is constant on Ñ, and Ñ ∩ {t = 0} = β̃ \ {0}.
- For every t, closure(Ñ_t) contains at least one point of π^{-1}(J_t), where J_t := H_t(J).
- If D lies in a product-type stratum and the vertex c of D is constant on D with c = {x} along β̃, then Ñ_t ⊂ L_x and F_x ≡ φ_c(t) on Ñ_t. Here φ_c(t) is the (constant) value of c on the transported piece D_t = H_t(D). The proof uses L1 for product type (R7-5 §1.2), which I checked.
- t ↦ φ_c(t) is holomorphic (R7-3 Lemma 1(a)).
- Since L_x is closed and F_x is continuous on it, **F_x ≡ φ_c(t) on closure(Ñ_t) ∩ L_x = closure(Ñ_t)**. (∗)

**Input (K′) (Prop K, PR-H §3, in the reading of R7-3 §1).** Taken as input, "proved modulo routine marking details" there and not re-proved here. There are:
- points J_0 = P ∈ ∂V_0, J_1, …, J_{k−1} (junctions) and J_k = Q_0 (endpoint), all in B_0;
- pieces D^1, …, D^k at time 0, with D^1 the component of ∂V_0 through P;
- for each m, a vertex c_m of D^m that is constant on D^m with value ≅ Y_0, where c_1 = i;
- for 1 ≤ m ≤ k−1: lifted branches β̃^m_+ (of D^m) and β̃^{m+1}_− (of D^{m+1}) at 0 ∈ Def(J_m), and a chart vertex x_m of G_{J_m}, with c_m = {x_m} along β̃^m_+ and c_{m+1} = {x_m} along β̃^{m+1}_−;
- at Q_0: a lifted branch β̃^k_+ of D^k with c_k = {x}, and a lifted branch β̃^E at 0 ∈ Def(Q_0) of a piece E, of one of three types:
  - **(MERGE)** the vertex class u of E containing x contains an edge of G_{Q_0} that is unpinched along β̃^E;
  - **(pMOV)** x is intact along β̃^E, f_{\{x\}} is non-constant on E, and Q_0 ∉ stratum(E);
  - **(iMOV)** as (pMOV), but Q_0 ∈ stratum(E) (a crossing).

**Hypothesis (PT_chain).** The pieces D^1, …, D^k and E lie in product-type strata. This is needed for L1. R7-5 §1.4 shows that L1 can fail for non-product strata; this caveat is inherited from R7-1 (T2) and R7-2 (PT).

## 1. Two elementary lemmas

**Lemma 1 (identity theorem in the coarse space).** Let f, g: Δ → Z be holomorphic maps into a reduced complex space Z. If {f = g} has an accumulation point in Δ, then f ≡ g. If f takes values in a finite set A on a set with an accumulation point in Δ, then f is constant.

*Proof.*
- {f = g} is an analytic subset of Δ: locally, embed Z in C^N and compare coordinates. A proper analytic subset of the connected Δ is discrete, so one with an accumulation point is all of Δ.
- For the second claim, some a ∈ A is taken on a set with an accumulation point. Apply the first claim with g ≡ a. ∎

**Lemma 2 (the finite set from (Rig)).** Put
 F := { pr_u(κ) : (G, M, K) ∈ 𝒦, u ∈ M, κ ∈ K ∩ ∂(∏_{u∈M} M̄_u) }.
Let A ⊂ M_{g_i,n_i}/S_{n_i} be the finite set of classes of smooth components of elements of F, of type (g_i, n_i), taken with their special points.
1. F and A are finite. For every piece E at every time t, every u ∈ M(E) and every puncture p of E, f_u(p) ∈ F up to relabelling.
2. If Y is non-constant, then Z_A := {t : [Y_t] ∈ A} is a closed discrete subset of Δ.

*Proof.*
1. K is irreducible and not contained in the boundary, so K ∩ ∂ is a proper analytic subset of a compact irreducible curve, hence finite. 𝒦 is finite.
   - At a puncture p, some coordinate of ν(p) lies in a boundary. Constant vertices take values in M_w. So the boundary coordinate is some u ∈ M(E), and pr_{M(E)}ν(p) ∈ K(E) ∩ ∂.
   - (Rig) identifies (G, M(E), K(E)) with an element of 𝒦 up to Aut(G). This only renames the vertices and the marked points.
2. t ↦ [Y_t] is holomorphic (PR-A, composed with the quotient map). It is non-constant: otherwise Y_t would lie in a finite S_{n_i}-orbit, and by continuity Y would be constant. Lemma 1 then gives the claim. ∎

## 2. Theorem 1: MS8 under star coherence (proved, given the inputs listed)

**Notation.** Write Ñ^m_+ and Ñ^{m+1}_− for the transport families of β̃^m_+ and β̃^{m+1}_− at J_m. At m = k write Ñ^k_+ and Ñ^E for those of β̃^k_+ and β̃^E at Q_0. Put J_{m,t} := H_t(J_m). The two families compared at J_m are:
- Ñ^m_+ and Ñ^{m+1}_−, for m < k;
- Ñ^k_+ and Ñ^E, for m = k.

**Definition.**
- (SC_m) (*star coherence at J_m*): the set
 T_m := { t ∈ Δ_ε : closure(first family at J_m)_t ∩ closure(second family at J_m)_t ∩ π^{-1}(J_{m,t}) ≠ ∅ }
 has an accumulation point in Δ_ε.
- (NT_m): every σ ∈ Aut(J_m) fixes the tracked chart vertex (x_m, or x at m = k).
- (C_m) := (SC_m) or (NT_m).

**Theorem 1.** Assume:
- (R1), (R2) and the hypotheses of MS8, including (Rig);
- the input (K′), with endpoint of type MERGE or pMOV;
- (PT_chain);
- (C_m) for every m = 1, …, k.

Then Y_t = Y_0 for all t ∈ Δ.

*Proof.*

**Step 1: [φ_{c_m}] ≡ [Y] for all m, by induction.**
- *Base.* c_1 = i on the component D^1 of ∂V_0, and vertex i is ≡ Y_t on ∂V_t. So φ_{c_1} = Y.
- *Induction step, case (SC_m).* Let t ∈ T_m and pick j̃ in the triple intersection defining T_m. By (∗), applied to both families with the same chart vertex x_m:
 F_{x_m}(j̃) ≅ φ_{c_m}(t) and F_{x_m}(j̃) ≅ φ_{c_{m+1}}(t).
 So [φ_{c_{m+1}}(t)] = [φ_{c_m}(t)] = [Y_t] for t ∈ T_m. By Lemma 1, [φ_{c_{m+1}}] ≡ [Y].
- *Induction step, case (NT_m).* Pick any j̃^+ ∈ closure(Ñ^m_{+,t}) ∩ π^{-1}(J_{m,t}) and j̃^− ∈ closure(Ñ^{m+1}_{−,t}) ∩ π^{-1}(J_{m,t}). Both sets are nonempty (§0).
  - By (K1), j̃^− = σ j̃^+ for some σ ∈ Aut(J_m).
  - By (K3) and σ^{-1}x_m = x_m: F_{x_m}(j̃^−) ≅ F_{x_m}(j̃^+).
  - Conclude as in the (SC_m) case, now for every t ∈ Δ_ε.

**Step 2: the endpoint.** Let t ∈ T_k in case (SC_k), or any t ∈ Δ_ε in case (NT_k). Choose q̃ ∈ closure(Ñ^E_t) ∩ π^{-1}(Q_t) such that F_x(q̃) ≅ φ_{c_k}(t) ≅ Y_t. This uses Step 1 and (∗), and in case (NT_k) the (K3)-trick of Step 1.
- Pattern and vertex structure are constant on Ñ^E. So along Ñ^E_t the vertex class of x is the class u that it has along β̃^E.
- Take r_n ∈ Ñ^E_t with r_n → q̃. By (PT_chain), their images lie in the lifted transported piece E_t ⊂ ∏_w M_w. By properness of ν_t they converge to ν_t(p′) for some p′ ∈ Ē_t.
- H_t preserves strata and Q_0 ∉ stratum(E). So Q_t ∉ stratum(E_t), and ν_t(p′) ∉ ∏_w M_w, because ξ̄ maps ∏_w M_w into Δ_{G_E}. Hence p′ is a puncture.
- By continuity of the plumbing (Def1), f_u(p′) is the curve glued from the components F_y(q̃), y ∈ u, along the edges of u unpinched along β̃^E. Its component F_x(q̃) keeps its special points (R7-4 Lemma 1, step 3). So F_x(q̃) ≅ Y_t is a component of f_u(p′).
- **(MERGE).** f_u(p′) has a node. A constant vertex has a smooth limit, so u ∈ M(E_t). By Lemma 2, f_u(p′) ∈ F, so [Y_t] ∈ A.
- **(pMOV).** Here u = {x}. By R7-2 Lemma 2.1, applied to the irreducible lifted family of E (product type, Lemma R0), x ∈ M(E_t) for all t outside a closed discrete set D_E. For such t, f_x(p′) ≅ Y_t lies in F, so [Y_t] ∈ A.
- In both cases [Y_t] ∈ A for all t in T_k \ D_E (or Δ_ε \ D_E). This set has an accumulation point in Δ_ε, because D_E is closed and discrete. By Lemma 1, [Y] is constant. Since Y is continuous and the map M_{g_i,n_i} → M_{g_i,n_i}/S_{n_i} has finite fibres, Y is constant, i.e. Y_t = Y_0 for all t. ∎

*Remarks.*
1. Step 1 uses neither (Rig) nor "generic t". (Rig) enters only at the endpoint, through Lemma 2.
2. Theorem 1 is the common form of R7-3 Theorem A (which assumed (NT) everywhere) and R7-1 Theorem T (which assumed (Lock)). The new point is that (SC) is exactly what the twin step needs. Below it is shown to follow from a purely group-theoretic condition, (IP).

## 3. When does (SC) hold? Isotropy preservation and the orbifold reading (proved)

**Corollary 1.** (SC_m) holds in either of the following cases.
- (a) **(IP_m)**: |Aut(J_{m,t})| = |Aut(J_m)| for t in a set with an accumulation point in Δ_ε.
- (b) The lifted branch defining one of the two families at J_m is Aut(J_m)-invariant, i.e. Stab_{Aut(J_m)}(β̃) = Aut(J_m).

*Proof.*
- (a) By (K4), #π^{-1}(J_{m,t}) = |Aut(J_m)| / |Aut(J_{m,t})| = 1 for those t. Both closures contain a point of π^{-1}(J_{m,t}) (§0), so they contain the same point.
- (b) If a ∈ Stab(β̃), then aÑ is the component of π^{-1}(N) containing aβ̃ \ {0} = β̃ \ {0}. So aÑ = Ñ.
  - Hence closure(Ñ_t) ∩ π^{-1}(J_{m,t}) is a nonempty Stab(β̃)-invariant subset of one Aut(J_m)-orbit (K1). If Stab(β̃) = Aut(J_m), it is the whole orbit.
  - So it contains the point that the other closure contains. ∎

**Corollary 2.** Assume the hypotheses of Theorem 1, but replace (C_m) by: "(NT_m), (IP_m) or Corollary 1(b) holds at each J_m". Then Y_t = Y_0 for all t. ∎

**Remark (the orbifold reading).** M̄_g is an orbifold (a DM stack). Suppose "smoothly trivial family" in the problem is read in the orbifold category: the trivialization H, restricted to each stratum, is an orbifold isomorphism, so in particular it preserves isotropy groups. Then:
- **(R2^orb)** |Aut(H_t(z))| = |Aut(z)| for every z ∈ B_0 and every t.
- (R2^orb) gives (IP_m) at every point. So under (R2^orb), **the twin obstruction disappears entirely**. MS8 then holds whenever Prop K's endpoint is MERGE or pMOV.
- The only remaining case is the interior-MOV (crossing) endpoint, together with the inherited inputs (K′) and (PT_chain).

Under the coarse reading (R2) adopted by the task, (IP) is an extra hypothesis. Automorphisms of boundary points can disappear for t ≠ 0, and this is exactly the twin mechanism: §4 shows that a failure of (C_m) forces Aut(J_{m,t}) ⊊ Aut(J_m).

## 4. What a failure of (C_m) forces (proved)

Assume Y is non-constant. Put Z := Z_A ∪ Z_φ ∪ D_all, where:
- Z_A is as in Lemma 2;
- Z_φ is the union, over the finitely many pairs (D, c) with D a piece at time 0 and c a constant vertex of D such that [φ_c] ≢ [Y], of the coincidence sets {t : [φ_c(t)] = [Y_t]}. Each is closed and discrete by Lemma 1.
- D_all is the union, over the pieces at time 0 in product-type strata and the vertices non-constant on them, of the closed discrete exceptional sets of R7-2 Lemma 2.1.

Z is a finite union of closed discrete sets, hence closed and discrete. Call t ∈ Δ_ε \ Z *generic*.

**Proposition 3.** Assume (R1), (R2), (Rig), (K′), (PT_chain, extended to D^{m+1}), and that Y is non-constant.
- **(Junction.)** Suppose [φ_{c_m}] ≡ [Y] but [φ_{c_{m+1}}] ≢ [Y] for some m ≤ k−1. Then (C_m) fails; in particular (IP_m) fails, and (NT_m) fails. Moreover, for every generic t there is a ∈ Aut(J_m) with a^{-1}x_m ≠ x_m such that one of the following holds.
  - **(b) persistent twin.** Along β̃^{m+1}_−, the chart vertex a^{-1}x_m is a single intact vertex w of D^{m+1}, constant on D^{m+1}, with [φ_w] ≡ [Y]. So D^{m+1} carries two distinct constant vertices, c_{m+1} and w, both with value ≅ Y_0 at t = 0, and with different value functions.
  - **(c) junction crossing.** J_m ∈ stratum(D^{m+1}), and a^{-1}x_m is an intact vertex of D^{m+1} that is non-constant on D^{m+1}, with value ≅ Y_0 at J_m.
- **(Endpoint.)** Suppose the endpoint is MERGE or pMOV and [φ_{c_k}] ≡ [Y]. Then (C_k) fails. For every generic t there is a ∈ Aut(Q_0) with a^{-1}x ≠ x such that, along β̃^E, a^{-1}x is a single intact vertex w of E, constant on E, with [φ_w] ≡ [Y]. So Q_0 has two Y_0-copies, x and a^{-1}x, exchanged by a ∈ Aut(Q_0). The copy x merges or moves along β̃^E, while its twin stays along β̃^E and carries Y.

*Proof (junction).*
- (C_m) fails, since otherwise Step 1 of Theorem 1 would give [φ_{c_{m+1}}] ≡ [Y].
- Fix a generic t, and pick j̃ ∈ closure(Ñ^m_{+,t}) ∩ π^{-1}(J_{m,t}). By (∗), F_{x_m}(j̃) ≅ Y_t.
- The coarse branch β^{m+1}_− (or the germ of D^{m+1}, in the interior case) is transported to a branch at J_{m,t}. Its preimage near j̃ lies in ⋃_a (aÑ^{m+1}_−)_t and has j̃ in its closure (R7-4 Lemma 2(b); the interior case is identical). Choose a with j̃ ∈ closure((aÑ^{m+1}_−)_t).
- Along aÑ^{m+1}_−, the class of x_m is a·(the class of a^{-1}x_m along Ñ^{m+1}_−), by (K3). The latter class is the vertex w of D^{m+1} containing a^{-1}x_m along β̃^{m+1}_−, because the vertex structure is constant on Ñ.
- *w merged* (contains an unpinched edge). Then J_m ∉ stratum(D^{m+1}). As in Step 2 of Theorem 1, Y_t ≅ F_{x_m}(j̃) is a component of the puncture value of the non-constant vertex w of D^{m+1}_t. So [Y_t] ∈ A, contradicting t ∉ Z_A.
- *w = {a^{-1}x_m} intact and non-constant on D^{m+1}.*
  - If J_m ∉ stratum(D^{m+1}): since t ∉ D_all, w ∈ M(D^{m+1}_t), and its puncture value is ≅ Y_t. So [Y_t] ∈ A, a contradiction.
  - Otherwise we are in (c). The value at J_m is F_{a^{-1}x_m}(0) ≅ F_{x_m}(a·0) = F_{x_m}(0) ≅ Y_0.
- *w = {a^{-1}x_m} intact and constant on D^{m+1}.*
  - By (K3) and (∗), F_{x_m} ≡ φ_w(t) on closure((aÑ^{m+1}_−)_t). So [φ_w(t)] = [Y_t], and since t ∉ Z_φ, [φ_w] ≡ [Y].
  - If a^{-1}x_m = x_m, then w = c_{m+1}, contradicting [φ_{c_{m+1}}] ≢ [Y]. So a^{-1}x_m ≠ x_m.
  - Two distinct chart vertices that are both intact along β̃^{m+1}_− are distinct vertices of G_{D^{m+1}}. So w ≠ c_{m+1}, and both are constant with value ≅ Y_0 at t = 0. This is (b).
- In cases (b) and (c), a moves x_m, so (NT_m) fails. (IP_m) fails by Corollary 1(a). ∎

*Proof (endpoint).* Identical, with E in place of D^{m+1}.
- The cases "w merged" and "w intact, non-constant" give [Y_t] ∈ A, because Q_0 ∉ stratum(E) in the MERGE and pMOV cases, so the limit point is a puncture. This contradicts genericity.
- So w = {a^{-1}x} is intact and constant with [φ_w] ≡ [Y].
- If a^{-1}x = x, then x would be intact and constant along β̃^E, which contradicts MERGE/pMOV. ∎

**Meaning.** A twin jump needs one of two things:
- a whole piece D^{m+1} that carries two constant Y_0-vertices with different deformations ("persistent twins"), which Prop K's track enters on the wrong one;
- or, at the endpoint, a boundary point Q_0 with an automorphism exchanging the merging copy with a staying twin.

In both cases the automorphism group of the junction must drop for t ≠ 0. This is consistent with R7-3 Theorem B, but here it is derived with (Rig) replacing L2. It also locates the extra structure: persistent twins live on a whole piece of the chain, not only at an isolated point.


## Reminder
- Never assume V_t totally geodesic for t ≠ 0, and never assume H_t preserves automorphism groups.
- A claimed counterexample must check smoothness of V_0 (covering constructions with symmetry are often singular: PR-I), total geodesy, and the realisability of the family V_t. Unverified realisability must be stated as such.
- Begin with a plan/status line. End with: proved / not proved / open.
